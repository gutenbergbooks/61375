<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is now several years since this book was begun. It
has been delayed by a crowd of causes, by a temporary
loss of strength, by enforced absence from England, by
other occupations and interruptions of various kinds.
I mention this only because of the effect which I fear
it has had on the book itself. It has been impossible
to make it, what a book should, if possible, be, the
result of one continuous effort. The mere fact that the
kindness of the publishers allowed the early part to be
printed some years back has, I fear, led to some
repetition and even contradiction. A certain change
of plan was found unavoidable. It proved impossible
to go through the whole volume according
to the method of the earlier chapters. Instead of
treating Europe as a whole, I found it needful to divide
it into several large geographical groups. The result
is that each of the later chapters has had to go over
again some small amount of ground which had been
already gone over in the earlier chapters. In some
cases later lights have led to some changes of view
or expression. I have marked these, as far as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i" id="Page_i">{i}</a></span>
could, in the Additions and Corrections. If in any
case I have failed to do so, the later statement is the
one which should be relied on.</p>

<p>I hope that I have made the object of the work
clear in the Introductory Chapter. It is really a very
humble one. It aims at little more than tracing out
the extent of various states at different times, and at
attempting to place the various changes in their due
relation to one another and to their causes. I am not,
strictly speaking, writing history. I have little to do
with the internal affairs of any country. I have looked
at events mainly with reference to their effect on the
European map. This has led to a reversal of what to
many will seem the natural order of things. In a
constitutional history of Europe, our own island would
claim the very first place. In my strictly geographical
point of view, I believe I am right in giving it the last.</p>

<p>I of course assume in the reader a certain elementary
knowledge of European history, at least as
much as may be learned from my own General Sketch.
Names and things which have been explained there I
have not thought it needful to explain again. I need
hardly say that I found myself far more competent to
deal with some parts of the work than with others.
No one can take an equal interest in, or have an
equal knowledge of, all branches of so wide a subject.
Some parts of the book will represent real original
research; others must be dealt with in a far less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">{ii}</a></span>
thorough way, and will represent only knowledge got
up for the occasion. In such cases the reader will
doubtless find out the difference for himself. But
I have felt my own deficiencies most keenly in the
German part. No part of European history is to me
more attractive than the early history of the German
kingdom as such. No part is to me less attractive than
the endless family divisions and unions of the smaller
German states.</p>

<p>In the Slavonic part I have found great difficulty
in following any uniform system of spelling. I consulted
several Slavonic scholars. Each gave me advice,
and each supported his own advice by arguments
which I should have thought unanswerable, if I had
not seen the arguments in support of the wholly different
advice given me by the others. When the teachers
differ so widely, the learner will, I hope, be forgiven,
if the result is sometimes a little chaotic. I have tried
to write Slavonic names so as to give some approach to
the sound, as far as I know it. But I fear that I have
succeeded very imperfectly.</p>

<p>In such a crowd of names, dates, and the like, there
must be many small inaccuracies. In the case of the
smaller dates, those which do not mark the great
epochs of history, nothing is easier than to get wrong
by a year or so. Sometimes there is an actual difference
of statement in different authorities. Sometimes there
is a difference in the reckoning of the year. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">{iii}</a></span>
instance, In what year was Calais lost to England?
We should say 1558. A writer at the time would say
1557. Then again there is no slip of either pen or
press so easy as putting a wrong figure, and, except in
the case of great and obvious dates, or again when the
mistake is very far wrong indeed, there is no slip of pen
or press so likely to be passed by in revision. And again
there is often room for question as to the date which
should be marked. In recording a transfer of territory
from one power to another, what should be the date
given? The actual military occupation and the formal
diplomatic cession are often several years apart. Which
of these dates should be chosen? I have found it hard
to follow any fixed rule in such matters. Sometimes
the military occupation seems the most important point,
sometimes the diplomatic cession. I believe that in
each case where a question of this sort might arise, I
could give a reason for the date which has been chosen;
but here there has been no room to enter into discussions.
I can only say that I shall be deeply thankful
to any one who will point out to me any mistakes or
seeming mistakes in these or any other matters.</p>

<p>The maps have been a matter of great difficulty.
I somewhat regret that it has been found needful to
bind them separately from the text, because this looks
as if they made some pretensions to the character of
an historical atlas. To this they lay no claim. They
are meant simply to illustrate the text, and in no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">{iv}</a></span>
enter into competition either with such an elaborate
collection as that of Spruner-Menke, or even with
collections much less elaborate than that. Those maps
are meant to be companions in studying the history of the
several periods. Mine do not pretend to do more than
to illustrate changes of boundary in a general way. It
was found, as the work went on, that it was better on
the whole to increase the number of maps, even at the
expense of making each map smaller. There are disadvantages
both ways. In the maps of South-Eastern
Europe, for instance, it was found impossible to show
the small states which arose in Greece after the Latin
conquest at all clearly. But this evil seemed to be
counterbalanced by giving as many pictures as might be
of the shifting frontier of the Eastern Empire towards
the Bulgarian, the Frank, and the Ottoman.</p>

<p>In one or two instances I have taken some small
liberties with my dates. Thus, for instance, the map of
the greatest extent of the Saracen dominion shows all
the countries which were at any time under the Saracen
power. But there was no one moment when the
Saracen power took in the whole extent shown in the
map. Sind and Septimania were lost before Crete and
Sicily were won. But such a view as I have given
seemed on the whole more instructive than it would
have been to substitute two or three maps showing the
various losses and gains at a few years’ distance from
one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">{v}</a></span></p>

<p>I have to thank a crowd of friends, including some
whom I have never seen, for many hints, and for much
help given in various ways. Such are Professor Pauli
of Göttingen, Professor Steenstrup of Copenhagen,
Professor Romanos of Corfu, M. J.-B. Galiffe of
Geneva, Dr. Paul Turner of Budapest, Professor A. W.
Ward of Manchester, the Rev. H. F. Tozer, Mr.
Ralston, Mr. Morfill, Mrs. Humphry Ward, and my
son-in-law Arthur John Evans, whose praise is in all
South-Slavonic lands.</p>

League is not unlikely to affect the geography of Herzegovina;
but no change has yet (January 1881) taken place which can be

<p><a href="#Page_441">P. 441</a>, l. 8. How unpleasant this truth is felt to be in certain
quarters, is shown by a small incident of last year. I sent a set
of manuscript maps of Dalmatia to Mr. Arthur Evans for his
suggestions. Those maps vanished in the Imperial, Royal, and
Apostolic post-office, and never reached his address at Ragusa.
If therefore the revolutions of Dalmatian geography are less
accurately marked in this book than they should be, the fault is
not mine. In Imperial, Royal, and Apostolic quarters it is
doubtless inconvenient to allow any memory of days when free
Ragusa had not bowed to any self-styled Emperor, either from
Corsica or from Lorraine, or of still later days when free Tzernagora
reached to her own sea at Cattaro. Those who have made it
their business to filch the substance may naturally enough think
it their business to filch the picture also.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_450">P. 450</a>, l. 5 from bottom. It is quite accurate to say that the
Turk has never ruled at Tzetinje. It is perfectly true that the
Turk has more than once harried Montenegro and Tzetinje itself;
the Turk has professed to consider the land as included in a
pashalik; but Montenegro has never been a regularly and avowedly
tributary state, as Servia and Roumania were, as free Bulgaria
is still.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_452">P. 452</a>, l. 7 from bottom. The promises of Europe on this
head still remain unfulfilled (January 1881). It is hardly
needful to notice the diplomatic quibble that the European order
for the liberation of these lands was not contained in the document
strictly called the Treaty of Berlin, but in another paper
signed at the same time and place. The order has been renewed
during the present year at the Second Berlin Conference.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Definition
of Historical
Geography.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The work</span> which we have now before us is to trace
out the extent of territory which the different states
and nations of Europe and the neighbouring lands have
held at different times in the world’s history, to mark
the different boundaries which the same country has
had, and the different meanings in which the same name
has been used. It is of great importance carefully to
make these distinctions, because great mistakes as to the
facts of history are often caused through men thinking
and speaking as if the names of different countries, say
for instance England, France, Burgundy, Austria, have
always meant exactly the same extent of territory. Historical
geography, in this sense, differs from physical
geography which regards the natural features of the
earth’s surface. It differs also from studies like ethnology
and comparative philology, which have to do directly
with the differences between one nation and another, with
their movements from one part of the world to another,
and with the relations to be found among the languages
spoken by them. But, though it is distinct from these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
studies, it makes much use of them. For the physical
geography of a country always has a great effect upon
its political history, and the dispersions and movements
of different nations are exactly those parts of history
which have most to do with fixing the names and the
boundaries of different countries at different times.
<i>England</i>, for instance, is, in strictness, the land of the
English wherever they may settle, whether in their
old home on the European continent, or in the isle of
Britain, or in New England beyond the Ocean. But
the extent of territory which was in this way to become
England was largely determined by the physical circumstances
of the countries in which the English
settled. And the history of the English nation has
been influenced, above all things, by the fact that the
great English settlement which has made the English
name famous was made in an island. But, when
England had become the name of a distinct political
dominion, its meaning was liable to change as that
dominion advanced or went back. Thus the borders
of England and Scotland have greatly changed at
different times, and forgetfulness of this has led to
many misunderstandings in reading the history of
the two countries. And so with all other cases of the
kind; the physical nature of the country, and the settlements
of the different nations which have occupied it,
have always been the determining causes of its political
divisions. But it is with the political divisions that
historical geography has to deal in the first place.
With the nature of the land, and with the people who
occupy it, it has to deal only so far as they have influenced
the political divisions. Our present business
in short is, first to draw the map of the countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
with which we are concerned as it appeared after each
of the different changes which they have gone through,
and then to point out the historical causes which have
led to the changes on the map. In this way we shall
always see what was the meaning of any geographical
name at any particular time, and we shall thus avoid
mistakes, some of which have often led to really important
practical consequences.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distinction
of Geographical
and Political
Names.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>From this it follows that, in looking at the geography
of Europe for our present purpose, we must look first
at the land itself, and then at the nations which occupy
it. And, in so doing, it may be well first of all
to distinguish between two kinds of names which we
shall have to use. Some names of countries are strictly
geographical; they really mean a certain part of the
earth’s surface marked out by boundaries which cannot
well be changed. Others simply mean the extent of
country which is occupied at any time by a particular
nation, and whose boundaries may easily be changed.
Thus <i>Britain</i> is a strictly geographical name, meaning
an island whose shape and boundaries must always be
nearly the same. <i>England</i>, <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Wales</i>, are names
of parts of that island, called after different nations
which have settled in it, and the boundaries of all of
which have differed greatly at different times. <i>Spain</i>
again is the geographical name of a peninsula which is
almost as well marked out by nature as the island of
Britain. <i>Castile</i>, <i>Aragon</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, are political names
of parts of the peninsula of Spain. They are the names
of states whose boundaries have greatly varied, and
which have sometimes formed separate governments
and sometimes have been joined together.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>Gaul</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
again is the geographical name of a country which
is not so clearly marked out all round by nature as
the island of Britain and the peninsula of Spain, but
which is well marked on three sides, to the north,
south, and west. Within the limits of Gaul, names like
<i>France</i>, <i>Flanders</i>, <i>Britanny</i>, <i>Burgundy</i>, and <i>Aquitaine</i>,
are political names of parts of the country, whose limits
have varied as much at different times as those of the
different parts of Britain and Spain. This is the difference
between strictly geographical names which do not
alter and political names which do alter. No doubt
<i>Gaul</i> and <i>Britain</i> were in the beginning political names,
names given to the land from those who occupied it,
just as much as the names <i>France</i> and <i>England</i>. But
the settlements from which those lands took the names
of Gaul and Britain took place long before the beginning
of trustworthy history, while the settlements from
which parts of those lands took the names of France
and England happened in times long after trustworthy
history began, and for which we are therefore ready
with dates and names. Thus Gaul and Britain are the
oldest received names of those lands; they are the
names which those lands bore when we first hear
of them. It is therefore convenient to keep them
in use as strictly geographical names, as always meaning
that part of the earth’s surface which they meant
when we first hear of them. In this book therefore,
<i>Gaul</i>, <i>Britain</i>, <i>Spain</i>, and other names of the same kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
will always be used to mean a certain space on the
map, whoever may be its inhabitants, or whatever
may be its government, at any particular time. But
names like <i>France</i>, <i>England</i>, <i>Castile</i>, will be used to
mean the territory to which they were politically applied
at the time of which we may be speaking, a territory
which has been greater and less at different times.
Thus, the cities of Carlisle and Edinburgh have always
been in <i>Britain</i> since they were built. They have
sometimes been in <i>England</i> and sometimes not. The
cities of Marseilles, Geneva, Strassburg, and Arras have
always been in <i>Gaul</i> ever since they were built.
They have sometimes been in <i>France</i> and sometimes
not, according to political changes.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>Geographical Aspect of Europe.</i></h3>

<p>Our present business is with the Historical Geography
of Europe, and with that of other parts of the world
only so far as they concern the geography of Europe.
But we shall have to speak of all the three divisions
of the Old World, Europe, Asia, and Africa, in those
parts of the three which come nearest to one another,
and in which the real history of the world begins.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Mediterranean Lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These are those parts of all three which lie round the
Mediterranean sea, the lands which gradually came to
form the Empire of Rome. In these lands the boundaries
between the three great divisions are very easily marked.
Modern maps do not all place the boundary between
Europe and Asia at the same point; some make the
river Don the boundary and some the Volga. But
this question is of little importance for history. In the
earliest historical times, when we have to do only with
the countries round the Mediterranean sea, there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
be no doubt how much is Europe and how much is
Asia and Africa. Europe is the land to the north of
the Mediterranean sea and of the great gulfs which
run out of it. If an exact boundary is needed in the barbarous
lands north of the Euxine, the Tanais or Don is
clearly the boundary which should be taken. In all these
lands the Mediterranean and its gulfs divide Europe from
Asia. But the northern parts of the two continents really
form one geographical whole, the boundary between
them being one merely of convenience. A vast central
mass of land, stretching right across the inland parts of
the two continents, sends forth a system of peninsulas
and islands, to the north and south. And it is in the
peninsular lands of Europe that European history begins.</p>

<p>Alike in Europe and in Asia, the southern or peninsular
part of the continent is cut off from the central
mass by a mountain chain, which in Europe is nearly unbroken.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The peninsulas
of
Europe and
Asia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus the southern part of Europe consists of
the three great peninsulas of <i>Spain</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and what
we may, in a wide sense, call <i>Greece</i>. These answer
in some sort to the three great Oceanic peninsulas of
Asia, those of <i>Arabia</i>, <i>India</i>, and <i>India</i> beyond the
<i>Ganges</i>. But the part of Asia which has historically
had most to do with Europe is its Mediterranean peninsula,
the land known as <i>Asia Minor</i>. In the northern
part of each continent we find another system of
great gulfs or inland seas; but those in Asia have
been hindered by the cold from ever being of any
importance, while in Europe the Baltic sea and the
gulfs which run out of it may be looked on as forming
a kind of secondary Mediterranean. We may thus
say that Europe consists of two insular and peninsular
regions, north and south, with a great unbroken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
mass of land between them. But there are some parts
of Europe which seem as it were connecting links between
the three main divisions of the continent. Thus
we said that the three great peninsulas are cut off
from the central mass by a nearly unbroken mountain
chain. But the connexion of the central peninsula,
that of Italy, with the eastern one or Greece, is far
closer than its connexion with the western one, or
Spain. Italy and Spain are much further apart than
Italy and Greece, and between the Alps and the Pyrenees
the mountain chain is nearly lost. We might
almost say that a piece of central Europe breaks through
at this point and comes down to the Mediterranean.
This is the south-eastern part of Gaul; and Gaul may in
this way be looked on as a land which joins together the
central and the southern parts of Europe. But this is
not all; in the north-western corner of Europe lies that
great group of islands, two large ones and many small,
of which our own Britain is the greatest. The British
islands are closely connected in their geography and
history with Gaul on one side, and with the islands
and peninsulas of the North on the other. In this way
we may say that all the three divisions of Europe are
brought closely together on the western side of the
continent, and that the lands of Gaul and Britain are
the connecting links which bind them together.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Effect of Geography on History.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning
of history
in the
European
peninsulas.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Now this geographical aspect of the chief lands of
Europe has had its direct effect on their history. We
might almost take for granted that the history of Europe
should begin in the two more eastern among the three
great southern peninsulas. Of these two, Italy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
Greece, each has its own character. Greece, though it
is the part of Europe which lies nearest to Asia, is in a
certain sense the most European of European lands.
The characteristic of Europe is to be more full of peninsulas
and islands and inland seas than the rest of the Old
World.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Characteristics
of
Greece;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And Greece, the peninsula itself and the neighbouring
lands, are fuller of islands and promontories
and inland seas than any other part of Europe. On
the other hand, Italy is the central land of all southern
Europe, and indeed of all the land round the Mediterranean.
It was therefore only natural that Greece
should be the part of Europe in which all that is most
distinctively European first grew up and influenced other
lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And so, if any one land or city among the Mediterranean
lands was to rule over all the rest, it is in Italy,
as the central land, that we should naturally look for
the place of dominion. The destinies of the two peninsulas
and their relations to the rest of the world were
thus impressed on them by their geographical position.</p>

<p>If we turn to recorded history, we find that it is only
a working out of the consequences of these physical facts.
Greece was the first part of Europe to become civilized
and to play a part in history; but it was Italy, and in
Italy it was its most central city, Rome, which came to
have the dominion over the civilized world of early
times—that is, over the lands around the Mediterranean.
These two peninsulas have, each in its own
way, ruled and influenced the rest of Europe as no
other parts have done. All the other parts have been,
in one way or another, their subjects or disciples.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance of
the Roman
dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
effect of the geographical position of these countries is
also marked in the stages by which Rome advanced
to the general dominion of the Mediterranean lands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
She first subdued Italy; then she had to strive for
the mastery with her great rival Carthage, a city
which held nearly the same central position on the
southern coast of the Mediterranean which she herself
did on the northern. Then she subdued, step by step,
the peninsulas on each side of her and the other coast
lands of the Mediterranean—European, Asiatic, and
African. Into the central division of Europe she did not
press far, never having any firm or lasting dominion
beyond the Rhine and the Danube. Into Northern Europe,
properly so called, her power never reached at all.
But she subdued the lands which we have seen act as
a kind of connecting link between the different parts of
Europe, namely Gaul and the greater part of Britain.
Thus the Roman Empire, at its greatest extent, consisted
of the lands round the Mediterranean, together
with Gaul and Britain. For the possession of the Mediterranean
land would have been imperfect without the
possession of Gaul, and the possession of Gaul naturally
led to the possession of Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of
the geographical
position of<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In this way the early history of Greece and Italy,
and the formation of the Roman Empire, were affected
by the geographical character of the countries themselves.
The same was the case with the other European
lands when they came to share in that importance which
once belonged to Greece and Italy only.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Germany,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus Germany,
as being the most central part of Europe, came
at one time to fill something like the same position
which Italy had once held. It came to be the country
which had to do with all parts of Europe, east, west,
north, and south, and even to be a ruler over some of
them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>France,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
So, as France became the chief state of Gaul, it
took upon it something like the old position of Gaul as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
a means of communication between the different parts
of Western Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spain and
Scandinavia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile, as the Scandinavian
and Spanish peninsulas are both cut off in such a marked
way from the mainland of Europe, each of them has
often formed a kind of world of its own, having much
less to do with other countries than Germany, France,
and Italy had. The same was for a long time the case
with our own island. Britain was looked on as lying
outside the world.</p>

<p>Thus the geographical position of the European
lands influenced their history while their history was
still purely European. And when Europe began to send
forth colonies to other continents, the working of geographical
causes came out no less strongly. Thus the
position of Spain on the Ocean led Castile and Portugal
to be foremost among the colonizing nations of Europe.
For the same reason, our own country was one of the
chief in following their example, and so was France also
for a long time.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The colonizing
powers.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Holland too, when it rose into importance,
became a great colonizing power, and so did Denmark
and Sweden to some extent. But an Italian colony
beyond the Ocean was never heard of, nor has there
ever been a German colony in the same sense in which
there have been Spanish and English colonies. Meanwhile,
the north-eastern part of Europe, which in early
times was not known at all, has always lagged behind
the rest, and has become of importance only in later
times. This is mainly because its geographical position
has almost wholly cut it off both from the Mediterranean
and from the Ocean.</p>

<p>Thus we see how, in all these ways, both in
earlier and in later times, the history of every country
has been influenced by its geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Influence
of national
character.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
No doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
the history of each country has also been largely
influenced by the disposition of the people who have
settled in it, by what is called the national character.
But then the geographical position itself has often
had something to do with forming the national character,
and in all cases it has had an influence upon
it, by giving it a better or a worse field for working
and showing itself. Thus it has been well said that
neither the Greeks in any other country nor any
other people in Greece could have been what the
Greeks in Greece really were. The nature of the
country and the nature of the people helped one
another, and caused Greece to become all that it was
in the early times of Europe. It is always useful to
mark the points both of likeness and unlikeness of the
different nations whose history we study. And of this
likeness and unlikeness we shall always find that the
geographical character, though only one cause out of
several, is always one of the chief causes.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Geographical Distribution of Races.</i></h3>

<p>Our present business then is with geography as influenced
by history, and with history as influenced by
geography. With ethnology, with the relations of nations
and races to one another, we have to deal only
so far as they form one of the agents in history. And
it will be well to avoid, as far as may be, all obscure
or controverted points of this kind. But the great results
of comparative philology may now be taken for
granted, and a general view of the geographical disposition
of the great European races is needful as an
introduction to the changes which historical causes have
wrought in the geography of the several parts of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<p>In European ethnology one main feature is that
the population of Europe is, and from the very beginnings
of history has been, more nearly homogeneous,
at least more palpably homogeneous, than that of any
other great division of the world.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Europe an
Aryan
continent.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Whether we look
at Europe now, or whether we look at it at the earliest
times of which we have any glimmerings, it is pre-eminently
an Aryan continent. Everything non-Aryan
is at once marked as exceptional. We cannot say
this of Asia, where, among several great ethnical elements,
none is so clearly predominant as the Aryan
element is in Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Non-Aryan
remnants.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There are in Europe non-Aryan
elements, both earlier and later than the Aryan settlement;
but they have, as a rule, been assimilated to the
prevailing Aryan mass. The earlier non-Aryan element
consists of the remnants which still remain of
the races which the Aryan settlers found in Europe,
and which they either exterminated or assimilated to
themselves. The later elements consist of non-Aryan
races which have made their way into Europe within
historical times, in whose case the work of assimilation
has been much less complete. It follows almost naturally
from the position of Europe that the primæval
non-Aryan element has survived in the west and in the
north, while the later or intrusive non-Aryan element
has made its way into the east and the south. In
the mountains of the western peninsula, in the border
lands of Spain and Gaul, the non-Aryan tongue
of the <i>Basque</i> still survives. In the extreme north
of Europe the non-Aryan tongue of the <i>Fins</i> and
<i>Laps</i> still survives. The possible relations of these
tongues either to one another or to other non-Aryan
tongues beyond the bounds of Europe is a question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
purely philological concern, and does not touch historical
geography. But historical geography is touched
by the probability, rising almost to moral certainty,
that the isolated populations by whom these primitive
tongues are still spoken are mere remnants of the primitive
races which formed the population of Europe at
the time when the Aryans first made their way into
that continent. Everything tends to show that the
<i>Basques</i> are but the remnant of a great people whom
we may set down with certainty as the præ-Aryan
inhabitants of Spain and a large part of Gaul, and
whose range we may, with great probability, extend
over Sicily, over part at least of Italy, and perhaps as far
north as our own island. Their possible connexion with
the early inhabitants of northern Africa hardly concerns
us. The probability that they were themselves preceded
by an earlier and far lower race concerns us not at
all. The earliest historical inhabitants of south-western
Europe are those of whom the Basques are the surviving
remnant, those who, under the names of <i>Iberians</i>
and <i>Ligurians</i>, fill a not unimportant place in
European history.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Order of
the Aryan
settlement.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When we come to the Aryan settlements, we cannot
positively determine which among the Aryan races of
Europe were the earliest settlers in point of time.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greeks and
Italians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great race which, in its many sub-divisions, contains
the <i>Greeks</i>, the <i>Italians</i>, and the nations more
immediately akin to them, are the first among the
European Aryans to show themselves in the light of
history; but it does not necessarily follow that
they were actually the first in point of settlement.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Celts.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It may be that, while they were pressing through
the Mediterranean peninsulas and islands, the <i>Celts</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
were pressing their way through the solid central
land of Europe. The Celts were clearly the vanguard
of the Aryan migration within their own range, the
first swarm which made its way to the shores of
the Ocean. Partially in Spain, more completely in
Gaul and the British Islands, they displaced or assimilated
the earlier inhabitants, who, under their pressure
and that of later conquerors, have been gradually
shut up in the small mountainous region which they
still keep. Of the Celtic migration we have no historical
accounts, but all probability would lead us to
think that the Celts whom in historic times we find
on the Danube and south of the Alps were not emigrants
who had followed a backward course from the
great settlement in Transalpine Gaul, but rather detachments
which had been left behind on the westward
journey. Without attempting to settle questions as to
the traces of Celtic occupancy to be found in other
lands, it is enough for our purpose that, at the beginnings
of their history, we find the Celts the chief
inhabitants of a region stretching from the Rubico to
the furthest known points of Britain. Gaul, Cisalpine
and Transalpine, is their great central land, though
even here they are not exclusive possessors; they share
the land with a non-Aryan remnant to the south-west,
and with the next wave of Aryan new-comers to the
north-east.</p>

<p>The settlements of these two great Aryan races
come before authentic history. After them came the
<i>Teutonic</i> races, who pressed on the Celts from the east;
and in their wake, to judge from their place on the
map, must have come the vast family of the <i>Slavonic</i>
nations.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Teutons
and Slaves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the migrations of the Teutons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
Slaves come, for the most part, within the range of
recorded history. Our first glimpse of the Teutons
shows them in their central German land, already
occupying both sides of the Rhine, though seemingly
not very old settlers on its left bank. The long
wanderings of the various Teutonic and Slavonic
tribes over all parts of central Europe, their settlements
in the southern and western lands, are all
matters of history. So is the great Teutonic settlement
in the British islands, which partly exterminated,
partly assimilated, their Celtic inhabitants, so as to
leave them as mere a remnant, though a greater remnant,
as they themselves had made the Basques. And,
as the process which made the north-western islands
of Europe Teutonic is a matter of history, so also
are the later stages of the process which made
the northern peninsulas Teutonic. But it is only the
later stages which are historical; we know that in
the strictly Scandinavian peninsula the Teutonic invaders
displaced non-Aryan Fins; we have only to guess
that in the Cimbric Chersonêsos they displaced Aryan
Celts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lithuanians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But beyond the Teutons and Slaves lies yet
another Aryan settlement, one which, in a purely philological
view, is the most interesting of all, the small and
fast vanishing group which still survives in <i>Lithuania</i> and
the neighbouring lands. Of these there is historically
really nothing to be said. On the eastern shores of the
Baltic we find people whose tongue comes nearer than
any other European tongue to the common Aryan
model; but we can only guess alike at the date when
they came thither and at the road by which they came.</p>

<p>These races then, Aryan and non-Aryan, make up
the immemorial population of Europe. The remnants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
of the older non-Aryan races, and the successive waves
of Aryan settlement, are all immemorial facts which we
must accept as the groundwork of our history and our
geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements
among the
Aryan
races.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They must be distinguished from other
movements which are strictly matters of written history,
both movements among the Aryan nations themselves
and later intrusions of non-Aryan nations. Thus the
Greek colonies and the conquests of the Hellenized
Macedonians Hellenized large districts of Europe,
Asia, and Africa, partly by displacement, partly by
assimilation. The conquests of Rome, and the Teutonic
settlements within the Roman Empire, brought about
but little in the way of displacement, but a great deal
in the way of assimilation. The process indeed was
opposite in the two cases. The Roman conqueror
assimilated the conquered to himself; the Teutonic
conqueror was himself assimilated by those whom
he conquered. Britain and the Rhenish and Danubian
lands stand out as marked exceptions. The Slavonic
settlements in the East wrought far more of displacement
than the Teutonic settlements in the West. Vast
regions, once Illyrian or Thracian—that is, most likely,
more or less nearly akin to the Greeks—are now
wholly Slavonic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Later intrusion
of
Non-Aryan
races.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly come the incursions on European
lands made by non-Aryan settlers in historic times.
Their results have been widely different in different
cases.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Semitic.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Semitic <i>Saracens</i> settled in Spain and
Sicily, bringing with them and after them their African
converts, men possibly of originally kindred race with
the first inhabitants both of the peninsula and of the
island. These non-Aryan settlers have vanished. The
displacement of large bodies of them is a fact of comparatively
recent history, but it can hardly fail that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
some degree of assimilation must also have taken place.
Then come the settlements, chiefly in eastern Europe,
of those whom for our purpose it is enough to group
together as the Turanian nations. The <i>Huns</i> of Attila
have left only a name. The more lasting settlement
of the <i>Avars</i> has vanished, how far by displacement,
how far by assimilation, it might be hard to say. <i>Chozars</i>,
<i>Patzinaks</i>, a crowd of other barbarian races,
have left no sign of their presence.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Turanian.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>Bulgarians</i>,
originally Turanian conquerors, have been assimilated
by their Slavonic subjects. The Finnish <i>Magyars</i>
have received a political and religious assimilation;
their kingdom became a member of the commonwealth
of Christian Europe, though they still keep
their old Turanian language. The latest intruders
of all, the <i>Ottoman Turks</i>, still remain as they were
when they first came, aliens on Aryan and Christian
ground. But here again is a case of assimilation
the other way; the Ottoman Turks are an artificial
nation which has been kept up by the constant incorporation
of European renegades who have thrown
aside the speech, the creed, and the civilization of
Europe.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>The Eastern or Greek Peninsula.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Characteristics
of the
Eastern
peninsula.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Historical Geography of Europe, if looked at in
chronological order, must begin with the most eastern
of the three peninsulas of Southern Europe. Here the
history of Europe, and the truest history of the world,
began. It was in the insular and peninsular lands between
the Ionian and Ægæan seas that the first steps
towards European civilization were taken; it is there
that we see the first beginnings of art, science, and
political life. But Greece or <i>Hellas</i>, in the strict sense
of the name, forms only a part of the lands which
must be looked on as the great Eastern peninsula.
It is however its leading and characteristic portion.
As the whole peninsular land gradually tapers southwards
from the great mass of central Europe, it becomes
at each stage more and more peninsular, and
it also becomes at each stage more and more Greek.
Greece indeed and the neighbouring lands form,
as was long ago remarked by Strabo,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a series of
peninsulas within peninsulas. It is not easy to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
a name for the whole region, as it stretches far beyond
any limits which can be given to Greece in any age of
the world or according to any use of the name. But
the whole land seems to have been occupied by nations
more or less akin to the Greeks. The history of those
nations chiefly consists of their relations to the Greeks,
and all of them were brought more or less within the
range of Greek influences. We may therefore not
improperly call the whole land, as opposed to Italy
and Spain, the <i>Greek</i> peninsula. It has also been
called the <i>Byzantine peninsula</i>, as nearly answering to
the European part of the Eastern division of the Roman
Empire, when its seat of government was at Byzantion,
Constantinople, or New Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its chief
divisions.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Taking the great range of mountains which divides
southern from central Europe as the northern
boundary of the eastern or Greek peninsula, it may be
said to take in the lands which are cut off from the
central mass by the <i>Dalmatian Alps</i> and the range of
<i>Haimos</i> or <i>Balkan</i>. It is washed to the east, west, or
south, by various parts of the Mediterranean and its
great gulf the Euxine. But the northern part of this
region, all that lies north of the Ægæan Sea, taking
in therefore the whole of the Euxine coast, still keeps
much of the character of the great central mass of
Europe, and forms a land intermediate between that
and the more strictly peninsular lands to the south.
Still the boundary is a real one, for all the lands south
of this range have come more or less within Greek
influences, and have played their part in Grecian history.
But when we get beyond the mountains, into
the valley of the Danube, we find ourselves in lands
which, excepting a few colonies on the coast, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
hardly at all come under Greek influences till quite
modern times. This region between Haimos and the
more strictly Greek lands takes in <i>Thrace</i>, <i>Paionia</i>,
and <i>Illyria</i>. Of these, Thrace and Illyria, having a
sea coast, received many Greek colonies, especially on
the northern coast of the Ægæan and on the <i>Propontis</i>
or Sea of Marmora. The Thracian part of this region,
as bordering on these more distinctly Grecian seas,
became more truly a part of the Grecian world than
the other lands to the west of it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thrace and
Illyria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Yet geographically
Thrace is more widely cut off from Greece than Illyria is.
For there is no such great break on the western shore
of the great peninsula as that which, on the eastern side,
marks the point where we must draw the line between
Greece and its immediate neighbours and the lands to
the north of them. This is at the point where a peninsula
within a peninsula breaks off to the south, comprising
<i>Greece</i>, <i>Macedonia</i>, and <i>Epeiros</i>. There is here
no very special break on the Illyrian coast, but the
Ægæan coast of Thrace is fenced in as it were at its two
ends, to the east by the long narrow peninsula known
specially as the <i>Chersonêsos</i>, and to the west by the group
of peninsulas called <i>Chalkidikê</i>. These have nothing
answering to them on the Illyrian side beyond the
mere bend in the coast above Epidamnos. This last
point however marks the extent of the earlier Greek
colonization in those regions, and which has become
a still more important boundary in later times.</p>

<p>Beyond Chalkidikê to the west, the specially
Greek peninsula projects to the south, being itself
again composed of peninsulas within peninsulas.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greece
proper and
its peninsulas.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
<i>Ambrakian Gulf</i> on the west and the <i>Pagasaian</i> on
the east again fence off a peninsula to the south, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
which the more purely Greek lands are fenced off
from <i>Macedonia</i>, <i>Epeiros</i>, and <i>Thessaly</i>. Within this
peninsula again another may be marked off by a line
drawn from <i>Thermopylai</i> to the <i>Corinthian</i> gulf near
Delphoi. This again shuts out to the east <i>Akarnania</i>,
<i>Aitolia</i>, and some other of the more backward divisions
of the Greek name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Peloponnêsos.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus <i>Phôkis</i>, <i>Boiôtia</i>, and
<i>Attica</i> form a great promontory, from which Attica
projects as a further promontory to the south-east,
while the great peninsula of <i>Peloponnêsos</i>—itself made
up on its eastern and southern sides of smaller
peninsulas—is joined on by the narrow isthmus of
Corinth. In this way, from Haimos to <i>Tainaros</i>, the
land is ever becoming more and more broken up by
greater or smaller inlets of the sea. And in proportion
as the land becomes more strictly peninsular, it also
becomes more strictly Greek, till in Peloponnêsos we
reach the natural citadel of the Greek nation.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Insular and Asiatic Greece.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Continuous
Hellas.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Greece Proper then, what the ancient geographers
called <i>Continuous Hellas</i> as distinguished from the Greek
colonies planted on barbarian shores, is, so far as it is
part of the mainland, made up of a system of peninsulas
stretching south from the general mass of eastern Europe.
But the neighbouring islands equally form a part of
continuous Greece; and the other coasts of the Ægæan,
Asiatic as well as Thracian, were so thickly strewed
with Greek colonies as to form, if not part of continuous
Greece, yet part of the immediate Greek world. The
western coast, as it is less peninsular, is also less insular,
and the islands on the western side of Greece did not
reach the same importance as those on the eastern side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
Still they too, the Ionian islands of modern geography,
form in every sense a part of Greece.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Islands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the north of
<i>Korkyra</i> or <i>Corfu</i> there are only detached Greek
colonies, whether on the mainland or in the islands;
but all the islands of the Ægæan are, during historical
times, as much part of Greece as the mainland; and
one island on each side, <i>Leukas</i> on the west and the
greater island of <i>Euboia</i> on the east, might almost be
counted as parts of the mainland, as peninsulas rather
than islands. To the south the long narrow island of
<i>Crete</i> forms a sort of barrier between Greek and barbarian
seas. It is the most southern of the purely
Greek lands. <i>Sicily</i> to the east and <i>Cyprus</i> to the
west received many Greek colonies, but they never
became purely Greek in the same way as Crete and the
islands to the north of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Asiatic
Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But, besides the European peninsulas and the islands,
part of Asia must be looked on as forming part of the immediate
Greek world, though not strictly of continuous
Greece. The peninsula known as <i>Asia Minor</i> cannot be
separated from Europe either in its geography or in its
history. With its central mass we have little or nothing
to do; but its coasts form a part of the Greek world, and
its Ægæan coast was only less thoroughly Greek than
Greece itself and the Greek islands. It would seem that
the whole western coast of Asia Minor was inhabited by
nations which, like the European neighbours of Greece,
were more or less nearly akin to the Greeks. And the
Ægæan coast of Asia is almost as full of inlets of the
sea, of peninsulas and promontories and islands near to
the shore, as European Greece itself. All these shores
therefore received Greek colonies. The islands and
the most tempting spots on the mainland were occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
by Greek settlers, and became the sites of Greek cities.
But Greek influence never spread very far inland, and
even the coast itself did not become so purely Greek
as the islands. When we pass from the Ægæan coast
of Asia to the other two sides of the peninsula,
to its northern coast washed by the Euxine and its
southern coast washed by the Mediterranean, we
have passed out of the immediate Greek world.
Greek colonies are found on favourable spots here
and there; but the land, even the coast as a whole, is
barbarian.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Ethnology of the Eastern Peninsula.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Greeks
and the
kindred
races.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The immediate Greek world then as opposed to
the outlying Greek colonies, consists of the shores
of the Ægæan sea and of the peninsulas lying between
it and the Ionian sea. Of this region a great part
was exclusively inhabited by the Greek nation, while
Greek influences were more or less dominant throughout
the whole. But it would further seem that the
whole, or nearly the whole, of these lands were inhabited
by races more or less akin to the Greeks.
They seem to have been races which had a good
deal in common with the Greeks, and of whom
the Greeks were simply the foremost and most fortunate,
their higher developement being doubtless greatly
favoured by the geographical nature of the country
which they occupied. But a distinction must be drawn
between the nearer and the more remote neighbours
of Greece. It is hardly necessary for our present purpose
to determine whether the Greeks had or had not
any connexion with Thracians, European or Asiatic, with
Phrygians and Lydians, and other neighbouring nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nations
more remote,
but
probably
kindred.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All these were in Greek eyes simply Barbarians, but
modern scholarship has seen in them signs of a kindred
with the Greek nation nearer than the share of both
in the common Aryan stock. We need not settle here
whether all the inhabitants of the geographical district
which we have marked out were, or were not, kinsmen
in this sense; but with some among them the question
assumes a deeper interest and a nearer approach to
certainty.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Illyrians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great Illyrian race, of whom the
Albanians or <i>Skipetars</i> are the modern representatives,
a race which has been so largely displaced by
Slaves at one end and assimilated by Greeks at the
other, can hardly fail to have had a nearer kindred with
the Greeks than that which they both share with Celts
and Teutons. When we come to the lands which are
yet more closely connected with Greece, both in geographical
position and in their history, the case becomes
clearer still.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Epeiros,
Macedonia,
Sicily and
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We can hardly doubt of the close connexion
between the Greeks and the nations which
bordered on Greece immediately to the north in
Epeiros and Macedonia, as well as with some at
least of those which they found occupying the opposite
coasts of the Ægæan, as well as in Sicily
and Italy. The Greeks and Italians, with the nations
immediately connected with them, clearly belong to
one, and that a well marked, division of the Aryan
family. Their kindred is shown alike by the evidence
of language and by the remarkable ease with
which in all ages they received Greek civilization.
Into more minute inquiries as to these matters it
is hardly our province to go here.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pelasgians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is perhaps
enough to say that the <i>Pelasgian</i> name, which has
given rise to so much speculation, seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
been used by the Greeks themselves in a very
vague way, much as the word <i>Saxon</i> is among ourselves.
It is therefore dangerous to form any theories
about the matter. Sometimes the Pelasgians seem to
be spoken of simply as <i>Old-Hellênes</i>, sometimes as a
people distinct from the Hellênes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Greek
nation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Whether the Hellênes,
on their entering into Greece, found the land
held by earlier inhabitants, whether Aryan or non-Aryan,
is a curious and interesting speculation, but one
which does not concern us. It is enough for our
purpose that, as far back as history or even legend can
carry us, we find the land in the occupation of a branch
of the Aryan family, consisting, like all other nations,
of various kindred tribes. It is a nation which is as
well defined as any other nation, and yet it shades off,
as it were, into the other nations of the kindred stock.
Clearly marked as Greek and Barbarian are from the
beginning, there still are frontier tribes in Epeiros and
Macedonia which must be looked on as forming an
intermediate stage between the two classes, and which
are accordingly placed by different Greek writers sometimes
in one class and sometimes in the other.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>The Earliest Geography of Greece and the Neighbouring Lands.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Homeric
map of
Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Our first picture of Greek geography comes from
the Homeric catalogue. Whatever may be the historic
value of the Homeric poems in general, it is clear that
the catalogue in the second book of the Iliad must represent
a real state of things. It gives us a map of Greece
so different from the map of Greece at any later time
that it is inconceivable that it can have been invented
at any later time. We have in fact a map of Greece at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
a time earlier than any time to which we can assign
certain names and dates. Within the range of Greece
itself the various Greek races often changed their
settlements, displacing or conquering earlier Greek
settlers; and the different states which they formed
often changed their boundaries by bringing other
states into subjection or depriving them of parts of
their territory. The Homeric catalogue gives us a
wholly different arrangement of the various branches
of the nation from any that we find in the Greece of
historic times. The <i>Dorian</i> and <i>Ionian</i> names, which
were afterwards so famous, are hardly known; the
name of <i>Hellênes</i> itself belongs only to a small district.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tribal divisions
of
Homeric
Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The names for the whole people are <i>Achaians</i>, <i>Argeians</i>
(<i>Argos</i> seeming to mean all Peloponnêsos), and
<i>Danaoi</i>, the last a name which goes quite out of use
in historic times. The boundary of Greece to the west
is narrower than it was in later times. The land called
<i>Akarnania</i> has not yet got that name, if indeed it was
Greek at all. It is spoken of vaguely as <i>Epeiros</i> or
the mainland,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and it appears as part of the possessions
of the king of the neighbouring islands, <i>Kephallênia</i>
and <i>Ithakê</i>. The islands to the north, <i>Leukas</i> and <i>Korkyra</i>,
were not yet Greek. The <i>Thesprotians</i> in Epeiros
are spoken of as a neighbouring and friendly
people, but they form no part of the Greek nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
The <i>Aitolians</i> appear as a Greek people, and so do
most of the other divisions of the Greek nation, only
their position and relative importance is often different
from what it was afterwards. Thus, to mention a few
examples out of many, the <i>Lokrians</i>, who, in historic
times, appear both on the sea of Euboia and on the
Corinthian gulf, appear in the catalogue in their
northern seats only.</p>

<p>When we turn from tribes to cities, the difference
is still greater.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Groupings
of cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The cities which held the first place in
historic times are not always those which are greatest
in the earlier time, and their grouping in federations or
principalities is wholly unlike anything in later history.
Thus in the historic <i>Boiotia</i> we find <i>Orchomenos</i> as
the second city of a confederation of which <i>Thebes</i>
is the first. In the catalogue Orchomenos and the
neighbouring city <i>Aspledôn</i> form a separate division,
distinct from Boiôtia. Euboia forms a whole; and,
what is specially to be noticed, <i>Attica</i>, as a land,
is not mentioned, but only the single city of <i>Athens</i>,
with <i>Salamis</i> as a kind of dependency. Peloponnêsos
again is divided in a manner quite different from
anything in later times. The ruling city is <i>Mykênê</i>,
whose king holds also a general superiority over
all Hellas, while his immediate dominion takes in
<i>Corinth</i>, <i>Kleônai</i>, <i>Sikyôn</i>, and the whole south coast of
the Corinthian Gulf, the <i>Achaia</i> of later times. The
rest of the cities of the Argolic peninsula are grouped
round <i>Argos</i>. Northern Greece again is divided into
groups of cities which answer to nothing in later times.
And its relative importance in the Greek world is
clearly far greater than it was in the historic period.</p>

<p>The catalogue also helps us to our earliest picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
of the northern and eastern coasts of the Ægæan and
of the Ægæan islands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
Greek colonization.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We see the extent which Greek
colonization had already made. It had as yet taken
in only the southern islands of the Ægæan. <i>Crete</i> was
already Greek; so were <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>Kôs</i>, and the neighbouring
islands; but these last are distinctly marked
as new settlements. The coast of Asia and the northern
islands are still untouched, except through the events of
the Trojan war itself, in which the Greek conquest of
<i>Lesbos</i> is distinctly marked.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Asiatic
Catalogue.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Asia, besides <i>Trojans</i>
and <i>Dardanians</i>, we find <i>Pelasgians</i> as a distinct
people, as also <i>Paphlagonians</i>, <i>Mysians</i>, <i>Phrygians</i>,
<i>Maionians</i>, <i>Karians</i>, and <i>Lykians</i>. We find in short
the nations which fringe the whole Ægæan coast of
Asia and the south-western coast of the Euxine. In
Europe again we have Thracians and Paionians, names
familiar in historic times, and whose bearers seemingly
occupied nearly the same lands which they do in later
times. The presence of Thracians in Asia is implied
rather than asserted. The <i>Macedonian</i> name is not
found. The northern islands of the Ægæan are mentioned
only incidentally. Everything leaves us to believe
that the whole region, European and Asiatic, to which
we are now concerned, was, at this earliest time of
which we have any glimpses, occupied by various races
more or less closely allied to each other.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phœnician
and Greek
settlements
in the islands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The islands
were largely Karian, but the <i>Phœnicians</i>, a Semitic
people from the eastern coast, seem to have planted
colonies in several of the Mediterranean islands. But
Karians and Phœnicians had now begun to give way to
Greek settlements. The same rivalry in short between
Greeks and Phœnicians must have gone on in the earliest
times in the islands of the Ægæan which went on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
historical times in the greater islands of Cyprus and
Sicily.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>Change from Homeric to Historic Greece.</i></h3>

<p>The state of things which is set before us in the
catalogue was altogether broken up by later changes,
but changes which still come before the beginnings of
contemporary history, and which we understand chiefly
by comparing the geography of the catalogue with the
geography of later times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes in
Peloponnêsos.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
According to received tradition,
a number of <i>Dorian</i> colonies from Northern
Greece were gradually planted in the chief cities of
Peloponnêsos, and drove out or reduced to subjection
their older <i>Achaian</i> inhabitants. Mykênê from this time
loses its importance; Argos, Sparta, Corinth, and Sikyôn
become Dorian cities; and Sparta gradually wins the
dominion over all the towns, whether Dorian or Achaian,
within her immediate dominion of Lakonia. To the west
of Lakonia arises the Dorian state of <i>Messênê</i>, which is
the name only of a district, as there was as yet no
city so called. As part of the same movement, an
Aitolian colony is said to have occupied <i>Êlis</i> on the
west coast of Peloponnêsos. Elis again was at this
time the name of a district only; the cities both of
Messênê and Êlis are of much later date. First Argos,
and then Sparta, rises to a supremacy over their fellow-Dorians
and over the whole of Peloponnêsos. Historical
Peloponnêsos thus consists (i) of the cities, chiefly
Dorian, of the Argolic <i>Aktê</i> or peninsula, together with
<i>Corinth</i> on the Isthmus and <i>Megara</i>, a Dorian outpost
beyond the Isthmus; (ii) of <i>Lakonikê</i>, the district immediately
subject to Sparta, with a boundary towards
Argos which changed as Sparta advanced and Argos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
went back; (iii) of <i>Messênê</i>, which was conquered by
Sparta before the age of contemporary history, and was
again separated in the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; (iv) of <i>Elis</i>,
with the border-districts between it and Messênê; (v)
of the <i>Achaian</i> cities on the coast of the Corinthian
Gulf; (vi) of the inland country of <i>Arkadia</i>. The
relations among these districts and the several cities
within them often fluctuated, but the general aspect of
the map of Peloponnêsos did not greatly change from
the beginning of the fifth century to the later days of
the third.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes in
Northern
Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>According to the received traditions, migrations of
the same kind took place in Northern Greece also between
the time of the catalogue and the beginning of
contemporary history. Thus Thessaly, whose different
divisions form a most important part of the catalogue, is
said to have suffered an invasion at the hands of the half
Hellenic <i>Thesprotians</i>. They are said to have become
the ruling people in Thessaly itself, and to have held a
supremacy over the neighbouring lands, including the
peninsula of Magnêsia and the Phthiôtic Achaia. It is
certain that in the historical period Thessaly lags in the
back ground, and that the true Hellenic spirit is much
less developed there than in other parts of Greece. There
is less reason to accept the legend of a migration out of
Thessaly into Boiôtia; but in historic times Orchomenos
no longer appears as a separate state, but is the second
city of the Boiotian confederacy, yielding the first place
to Thebes with great unwillingness. The Lokrians
also now appear on the Corinthian gulf as well as on
the sea of Euboia. And the land to the west of Aitôlia,
so vaguely spoken of in the catalogue, has become the
seat of a Greek people under the name of <i>Akarnania</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
The Corinthian colonies along this coast, the city of
<i>Ambrakia</i>, the island or peninsula of <i>Leukas</i>, the
foundation of which is placed in the eighth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, come almost within the time of trustworthy
history. They are not Greek in the catalogue; they
are Greek when we first hear of them in history.
Ambrakia forms the last outpost of continuous Hellas
towards the north-west; beyond that are only outlying
settlements on the Illyrian coasts and islands.</p>

<p>These changes in the geography of continental
Greece, both within and without Peloponnêsos, make
the main differences between the Greece of the Homeric
catalogue and the Greece of the Persian and
Peloponnesian wars.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes in
later times.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
During the sixth, fifth, and fourth
centuries before Christ there were constant changes in
political relations of the Greek states to one another;
but there were not many changes which greatly affected
the geography. Cities were constantly brought in subjection
to one another, and were again relieved from
the yoke.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;370-369.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the course of the fourth century two new
Peloponnesian cities, <i>Messênê</i> and <i>Megalopolis</i>, were
founded. In Boiotia again, <i>Plataia</i> and <i>Orchomenos</i>
were destroyed by the Thebans, and Thebes itself was
destroyed by Alexander, but these were afterwards
rebuilt.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;468.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Peloponnêsos Mykênê was destroyed by
the Argeians, and never rebuilt. But most of these
changes do not affect geography, as they did not involve
any change in the seats of the great divisions
of the Greek name. The only exception is that of
the foundation of <i>Messênê</i>, which was accompanied by
the separation of the old Messenian territory from
Sparta, and the consequent establishment of a new or
restored division of the Greek nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span></p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>The Greek Colonies.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Ægæan
colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It must have been in the time between the days represented
by the catalogue and the beginnings of contemporary
history, that most of the islands of the Ægæan
became Greek, and that the Greek colonies were planted
on the Ægæan coast of Asia. We have seen that the
southern islands were already Greek at the time of the
catalogue, while some of the northern ones, <i>Thasos</i>,
<i>Lêmnos</i>, and others, did not become Greek till times to
which we can give approximate dates, from the eighth
to the fifth centuries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonies
in Asia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
During this period, at some time
before the eighth century, the whole Ægæan coast of
Asia had become fringed with Greek cities, <i>Dorian</i> to
the south, <i>Aiolian</i> to the north, <i>Ionian</i> between the
two. The story of the Trojan war itself in the land
is most likely a legendary account of the beginning of
these settlements, which may make us think that the
Greek colonization of this coast began in the north, in
the lands bordering on the Hellespont. At all events,
by the eighth century these settlements had made the
Asiatic coast and the islands adjoining it a part, and a
most important part, not only of the Greek world, but
we may almost say of Greece itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their early
greatness.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Ionian cities,
above all, <i>Smyrna</i>, <i>Ephesos</i>, <i>Milêtos</i>, and the islands of
<i>Chios</i> and <i>Samos</i>, were among the greatest of Greek
cities, more flourishing certainly than any in European
Greece. Milêtos, above all, was famous for the number
of colonies which it sent forth in its own turn. But, if
their day of greatness came before that of the European
Greeks, they were also the first to come under
the power of the Barbarians.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lydian and
Persian
conquests.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the course of the fifth
century the Greek cities on the continent of Asia came
under the power, first of the <i>Lydian</i> kings and then of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
their <i>Persian</i> conquerors, who subdued several of the
islands also. It was this subjection of the Asiatic
Greeks to the Barbarians which led to the Persian
war, with which the most brilliant time in the history
of European Greece begins. We thus know the Asiatic
cities only in the days of their decline.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonies in
Thrace.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The coasts of
Thrace and Macedonia were also sprinkled with Greek
cities, but they did not lie so thick together as those
on the Asiatic coast, except only in the three-fingered
peninsula of <i>Chalkidikê</i>, which became a thoroughly
Greek land. Some of these colonies in Thrace, as
<i>Olynthos</i> and <i>Potidaia</i>, play an important part in Greek
history, and two among them fill a place in the history
of the world. <i>Thermê</i>, under its later name of <i>Thessalonikê</i>,
has kept on its importance under all changes
down to our own time. And <i>Byzantion</i>, on the Thracian
Bosporos, rose higher still, becoming, under the
form of <i>Constantinople</i>, the transplanted seat of the
Empire of Rome.</p>

<p>The settlements which have been thus far spoken of
may be all counted as coming within the immediate
Greek world. They were planted in lands so near to
the mother-country, and they lay so near to one another,
that the whole country round the Ægæan may be
looked on as more or less thoroughly Greek. Some
parts were wholly Greek, and everywhere Greek influences
were predominant.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>More distant
colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, during this same period
of distant enterprise, between the time of the Homeric
catalogue and the time of the Persian War, many Greek
settlements were made in countries much further off
from continuous Greece. All of course came within
the range of the Mediterranean world; no Greek ever
passed through the Straits of Hêraklês to found settlements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
on the Ocean. But a large part of the coast
both of the Mediterranean itself and of the Euxine
was gradually dotted with Greek colonies. These outposts
of Greece, unless they were actually conquered
by barbarians, almost always remained Greek; they kept
their Greek language and manners, and they often spread
them to some extent among their barbarian neighbours.
But it was not often that any large tract of country
in these more distant lands became so thoroughly
Greek as the Ægæan coast of Asia became. We may
say however that such was the case with the coast of
Sicily and Southern Italy, where many Greek colonies
were planted, which will be spoken of more fully in
another chapter. All Sicily indeed did in the end really
become a Greek country, though not till after its conquest
by the Romans. But in Northern and Central
Italy, the Latins, Etruscans, and other Italian nations
were too strong for any Greek colonies to be made in
those parts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonies in
the Hadriatic.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the other side of the Hadriatic, Greek
colonies had spread before the Peloponnesian war as
far north as <i>Epidamnos</i>. The more northern colonies
on the coast and among the islands of Dalmatia, the
Illyrian <i>Epidauros</i>, <i>Pharos</i>, <i>Black Korkyra</i>, and others,
were among the latest efforts of Greek colonization in
the strict sense.</p>

<p>In other parts of the Mediterranean coasts the
Greek settlements lay further apart from each other.
But we may say that they were spread here and there
over the whole coast, except where there was some
special hindrance to keep the Greeks from settling.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phœnician
colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus, in a great part of the Mediterranean the
Phœnicians had got the start of the Greeks, both in
their own country on the coast of Syria, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
colonies sent forth by their great cities of Tyre and
Sidon. The Phœnician colonists occupied a large part
of the western half of the southern coast of the
Mediterranean, where lay the great Phœnician cities of
<i>Carthage</i>, <i>Utica</i>, and others. They had also settlements
in Southern Spain, and one at least outside the straits
on the Ocean. This is <i>Gades</i> or <i>Cadiz</i>, which has kept
its name and its unbroken position as a great city from
an earlier time than any other city in Europe. The
Greeks therefore could not colonize in these parts.
In the great islands of Sicily and Cyprus there were
both Phœnician and Greek colonies, and there was a
long struggle between the settlers of the two nations.
In Egypt again, though there were some Greek settlers,
yet there were no Greek colonies in the strict sense.
That is, there were no independent Greek commonwealths.
Thus the only part of the southern coast of
the Mediterranean which was open to Greek colonization
was the land between Egypt and the dominions of
Carthage.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greek colonies
in
Africa,
Gaul, and
Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In that land accordingly several Greek
cities were planted, of which the chief was the famous
<i>Kyrênê</i>. On the southern coast of Gaul arose the
great Ionian city of <i>Massalia</i> or <i>Marseilles</i>, which also,
like the Phœnician Gades, has kept its name and its
prosperity down to our own time. Massalia became the
centre of a group of Greek cities on the south coast of
Gaul and the east coast of Spain, which were the means
of spreading a certain amount of Greek civilization in
those parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonies on
the Euxine.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Besides these settlements in the Mediterranean itself,
there were also a good many Greek colonies on the
western, northern, and southern coasts of the Euxine, of
which those best worth remembering are the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
<i>Chersonêsos</i> in the peninsula called the <i>Tauric Chersonêsos</i>,
now Crimea, and <i>Trapezous</i> on the southern
coast. These two deserve notice as being two most
abiding seats of Greek influence. Chersonêsos, under
the name of <i>Cherson</i>, remained an independent Greek
commonwealth longer than any other, and Trapezous or
<i>Trebizond</i> became the seat of Greek-speaking Emperors,
who outlived those of Constantinople. Speaking generally
then, we may say that, in the most famous times of
European Greece, in the time of the Persian and Peloponnesian
wars, the whole coast of the Ægæan was part
of the immediate Greek world, while in Sicily and
Cyprus Greek colonies were contending with the Phœnicians,
and in Italy with the native Italians. Massalia
was the centre of a group of Greek states in the north-west,
and Kyrênê in the south, while the greater part
of the coast of the Euxine was also dotted with Greek
cities here and there. In most of these colonies the
Greeks mixed to some extent with the natives, and
the natives to some extent learned the Greek language
and manners.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning

We thus get the beginning of what we
call an artificial Greek nation, a nation Greek in
speech and manners, but not purely Greek in blood,
which has gone on ever since.</p>


<h3>§ 7. <i>Growth of Macedonia and Epeiros.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
Macedonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But while the spread of the Greek language and
civilization, and therewith the growth of the artificial
Greek nation, was brought about in a great degree
by the planting of independent Greek colonies, it was
brought about still more fully by events which went
far to destroy the political independence of Greece
itself. This came of the growth of the kindred nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
to the north of Greece, in Macedonia and Epeiros. The
Macedonians were for a long time hemmed in by the
barbarians to the north and west of them and by the
Greek cities on the coast, and they were also weakened
by divisions among themselves.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reign of
Philip, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;
360-336.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But when the whole
nation was united under its great King Philip, Macedonia
soon became the chief power in Greece and the
neighbouring lands. Philip greatly increased his dominions
at the expense of both Greeks and barbarians,
especially by adding the peninsulas of Chalkidikê to his
kingdom. But in Greece itself, though he took to himself
the chief power, he did not actually annex any of
the Greek states to Macedonia, so that his victories there
do not affect the map.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Alexander,
336-323.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
His yet more famous son Alexander,
and the Macedonian kings after him, in like
manner held garrisons in particular Greek cities, and
brought some parts of Greece, as Thessaly and Euboia,
under a degree of Macedonian influence which hardly
differed from dominion; but they did not formally
annex them. The conquests of Alexander in Asia
brought most of the Greek cities and islands under
Macedonian dominion, but some, as Crete, Rhodes,
Byzantion, and <i>Hêrakleia</i> on the Euxine, kept their
independence.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Epeiros
under Pyrrhos,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;
295-272.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile Epeiros became united
under the Greek kings of <i>Molossis</i>, and under Pyrrhos,
who made Ambrakia his capital, it became a powerful
state. And a little kingdom called <i>Athamania</i>, thrust
in between Epeiros, Macedonia, and Thessaly, now
begins to be heard of.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Macedonian
kingdoms
in Asia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The conquests of Alexander in Asia concern us only
so far as they called into being a class of states in Western
Asia, all of which received a greater or less share of
Hellenic culture, and some of which may claim a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
in the actual Greek world. By the division of the empire
of Alexander after the battle of Ipsos, <i>Egypt</i> became
the kingdom of Ptolemy, with whose descendants
it remained down to the Roman conquest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;301.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The civilization
of the Egyptian court was Greek, and Alexandria
became one of the greatest of Greek cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Egypt
under the
Ptolemies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Moreover
the earlier kings of the Ptolemaic dynasty held various
islands in the Ægæan, and points on the coast of Asia
and even of Thrace, which made them almost entitled
to rank as a power in Greece itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Seleukid
dynasty.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great Asiatic
power of Alexander passed to <i>Seleukos</i> and his descendants.
The early kings of his house ruled from the Ægæan
to the Hyphasis, though this great dominion was at all
times fringed and broken in upon by the dominions of
native princes, by independent Greek cities, and by the
dominions of other Macedonian kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Circa <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;
256.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But in the third
century their dominion was altogether cut short in the
East by the revolt of the Parthians in northern Persia,
by whom the eastern provinces of the Seleukid kingdom
were lopped away.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;191-181.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And when Antiochos the Great
provoked a war with Rome, his dominion was cut
short to the West also. The Seleukid power now shrank
up into a local kingdom of <i>Syria</i>, with Tauros for its
north-western frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cities of independent
state in
Asia Minor.<br />
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;283.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By the cutting short of the Seleukid kingdom, room
was given for the growth of the independent states
which had already sprung up in Asia Minor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pergamos.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The kingdom of <i>Pergamos</i> had already begun, and the
dominions of its kings were largely increased by the
Romans at the expense of Antiochos. Pergamos might
count as a Hellenic state, alongside of Macedonia and
Epeiros. But the other kingdoms of Asia Minor, <i>Bithynia</i>,
<i>Kappadokia</i>, <i>Paphlagonia</i>, and <i>Pontos</i>, the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
of the famous Mithridates, must be counted as
Asiatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spread of
Hellenic
culture.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Hellenic influence indeed spread itself far
to the East. Even the Parthian kings affected a certain
amount of Greek culture, and in all the more western
kingdoms there was a greater or less Greek element,
and in several of them the kings fixed their capitals in
Greek cities. Still in all of them the Asiatic element
prevailed in a way in which it did not prevail at Pergamos.
Meanwhile other states, either originally Greek
or largely Hellenized, still remained East of the Ægæan.
Thus, at the south-western corner of Asia Minor, <i>Lykia</i>,
though seemingly less thoroughly Hellenized than some
of its neighbours, became a federal state after the
Greek model.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Seleukeia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Far to the East, <i>Seleukeia</i> on the Tigris,
whether under Syrian or Parthian overlordship, kept
its character as a Greek colony, and its position as what
may be called a free imperial city. Further to the
West other more purely Greek states survived.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hêrakleia.<br />
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;188.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Pontic <i>Hêrakleia</i> long remained an independent Greek
city, sometimes a commonwealth, sometimes under
tyrants; and <i>Sinôpê</i> remained a Greek city till it became
the capital of the kings of Pontos. On the north of the
Euxine, <i>Bosporos</i> still remained a Greek kingdom.</p>


<h3>§ 8. <i>The later Geography of Independent Greece.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Later political
divisions
of
Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The political divisions of independent Greece, in the
days when it gradually came under the power of Rome,
differ almost as much from those to which we are used
during the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, as these last
differ from the earlier divisions in the Homeric catalogue.
The chief feature of these times was the power
which was held, as we have before seen, by the Macedonian
kings, and the alliances made by the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
Greek states in order to escape or to throw off their
yoke. The result was that the greater part of Greece
was gradually mapped out among large confederations,
much larger at least than Greece had ever seen before.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Achaian
League,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;280.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The most famous of these, the League of <i>Achaia</i>,
began among the old Achaian cities on the south of
the Corinthian Gulf.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;191.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It gradually spread, till it
took in the whole of Peloponnêsos, together with
Megara and one or two outlying cities. Thus Corinth,
Argos, Elis, and even Sparta, instead of being distinct
states as of old, with a greater or less dominion over
other cities, were now simply members of one federal
body.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Aitolian
League.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Northern Greece the League of <i>Aitolia</i> now
became very powerful, and extended itself far beyond
its old borders. Akarnania, Phôkis, Lokris, and
Boiôtia formed Federal states of less power, and so
did <i>Epeiros</i>, where the kings had been got rid of, and
which was now reckoned as a thoroughly Greek state.
The Macedonian kings held different points at different
times: Corinth itself for a good while, and Thessaly and
Euboia for longer periods, might be almost counted as
parts of their kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Roman interference
in Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This was the state of things in Greece at the
time when the Romans began to meddle in Greek and
Macedonian affairs, and gradually to bring all these
countries, like the rest of the Mediterranean world,
under their power. But it should be remarked that
this was done, as the conquests of the Romans always
were done, very gradually.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;229.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
First the island of Korkyra
and the cities of Epidamnos and Apollônia on
the Illyrian coast became Roman allies, which was always
a step to becoming Roman subjects.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;205.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Romans
first appeared in Greece itself, as allies of the Aitolians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
but by the Peace of Epeiros Rome obtained no
dominion in Greece, and merely some increase of her
Illyrian territory.

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;196.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The second Macedonian War made
Macedonia dependent on Rome, and all those parts of
Greece which had been under the Macedonian power
were declared free at its close.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;189.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the Aitolians had
joined Antiochos of Syria against Rome,
they were
made a Roman dependency. From that time Rome
was always meddling in the affairs of the Greek states,
and they may be counted as really, though not formally,
dependent on Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;169.<br />
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;149.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After the third Macedonian
war, Macedonia was cut up into four separate commonwealths;
and at last, after the fourth, it became a
Roman province.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146.<br />
Remaining
free states
incorporated
by
Vespasian.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
About the same time the Leagues
of Epeiros and Boiôtia were dissolved; the Achaian
League also became formally dependent on Rome, and
was dissolved for a time also. It is not certain when
Achaia became formally a Roman province; but, from
this time, all Greece was practically subject to Rome.
Athens remained nominally independent, as did Rhodes,
Byzantion, and several other islands and outlying cities,
some of which were not formally incorporated with
the Roman dominion till the time of the Emperor
Vespasian.</p>

<p>As we go on with the geography of other countries
which came under the Roman dominion, we shall
learn more of the way in which Rome thus enlarged
her territories bit by bit. But it seemed
right to begin with the geography of Greece, and
this could not be carried down to the time when
Greece became a Roman dominion without saying something
of the Roman conquest. From <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146 we must
look upon Greece and the neighbouring lands as being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
some of them formally and all of them practically,
part of the Roman dominion. And we shall not have
to speak of them again as separate states or countries
till many ages later, when the Roman dominion began
to fall in pieces. Having thus traced the geography of
the most eastern of the three great European peninsulas
down to the time when it became part of the dominion
which took in all the lands around the Mediterranean,
we will now go on to speak of the middle peninsula,
which became the centre of that dominion, namely that
of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Special
character of
Greek history.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Greece and the neighbouring lands are the
only parts of Europe which can be said to have a
history quite independent of Rome, and beginning
earlier than the Roman history. Of the other countries
therefore which became part of the Roman Empire it
will be best to speak in their relation to Italy, and,
as nearly as possible, in the order in which they came
under the Roman power.</p>

<p class="ph3">FORMATION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second of the three great peninsulas of southern
Europe, that which lies between the other two, is that
of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Different
meanings
of the name
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The name of Italy has been used in several
meanings at different times, but it has always meant
either the whole or a part of the land which we now call
Italy. The name gradually spread itself from the extreme
south to the north.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At the time when our
survey begins, the name did not go beyond the
long narrow peninsula itself; and indeed it hardly
took in the whole of that.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its meaning
under the
Roman
commonwealth.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
During the time of the
Roman commonwealth Italy did not reach beyond the
little rivers <i>Macra</i> on one side, near <i>Luna</i>, and <i>Rubico</i>
on the other side, near <i>Ariminum</i>. The land to the
north, as far as the Alps, was not counted for Italy till
after the time of Cæsar. But the Alps are the natural
boundary which fence off the peninsular land from the
great mass of central Europe; so that, looking at the
matter as a piece of geography, we may count the
whole land within the Alps as Italy. It will be at
once seen that the Italian peninsula, though so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
and narrow, is by no means cut up into promontories
and smaller peninsulas as the Greek peninsula is.
Nor is it surrounded by so many islands. It is only
quite in the south, where the long narrow peninsula
splits off into two smaller ones, that the coast has at all
the character of the Greek coast, and there only in a
much slighter degree.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Italian
islands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Close by this end of Italy lies
the great island of <i>Sicily</i>, whose history has always
been closely connected with that of Italy. Further off
lie the two other great islands of <i>Corsica</i> and <i>Sardinia</i>,
which in old times were not reckoned to belong to
Italy at all. Besides these there are several smaller
islands, <i>Elba</i> and others, along the Italian coast;
but they lie a good way from each other, and do not
form any marked feature in the geography. There
is nothing at all like even the group of islands off
western Greece, much less like the endless multitude,
great and small, in the Ægæan. Through the whole
length of the peninsula, like a backbone, runs the
long chain of the <i>Apennines</i>. These branch off from
the Alps in north-western Italy near the sea, and run
through the whole length of the country to the very
toe of the boot, as the Italian peninsula has been called
from its shape. From all this it follows that, though
Italy was the land which was destined in the end to
have the rule over all the rest, yet the people of Italy
were not likely to begin to make themselves a name so
early as the Greeks did. Least of all were they likely
to take in the same way to a sea-faring life, and to
plant colonies in far off lands.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>The Inhabitants of Italy and Sicily.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Non-Aryans
in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We seem to have somewhat clearer signs in Italy than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
we have in Greece of the men who dwelled in the land
before the Aryans who appear as its historical inhabitants
came into it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ligurians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the coast of <i>Liguria</i>, the land on
each side of the city of Genoa, a land which was not
reckoned Italian in early times, we find people who
seem not to have been Aryan. And these Ligurians
seem to have been part of a race which was spread
through Italy and Sicily before the Aryan settlements,
and to have been akin to the non-Aryan inhabitants of
Spain and southern Gaul, of whom the Basques on each
side of the Pyrenees remain as a remnant.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Etruscans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And in historical
times a large part of Italy was held, and in
earlier times a still larger part seems to have been held,
by the <i>Etruscans</i>. These are a people about whose
origin and language there have been many theories, but
nothing can as yet be said to be certainly known. These
Etruscans, in historical times, formed a confederacy
of twelve cities in the land west of the Apennines, between
the Macra and the Tiber; and it is believed that
in earlier times they had settlements both more to the
north, on the Po, and more to the south, in Campania.
If they were a non-Aryan race, the part of the non-Aryans
in the geography and history of Italy becomes
greater than it has been in any part of Western Europe
except Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Italians.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But whatever we make of the Etruscans, the rest of
Italy in the older sense was held by various branches of
an Aryan race nearly allied to the Greeks, whom we may
call the <i>Italians</i>. Of this race there were two great
branches. One of them, under various names, seems to
have held all the southern part of the western coast of
Italy, and to have spread into Sicily. Some of the tribes
of this branch seem to have been almost as nearly akin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
to the Greeks as the Epeirots and other kindred nations
on the east side of the Hadriatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Latins.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of this branch of the
Italian race, the most famous people were the <i>Latins</i>;
and it was the greatest Latin city, the border city of
the Latins against the Etruscans, the city of <i>Rome</i> on
the Tiber, which became, step by step, the mistress of
Latium, of Italy, and of the Mediterranean world.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Opicans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
other branch, which held a much larger part of the
peninsula, taking in the <i>Sabines</i>, <i>Æquians</i>, <i>Volscians</i>,
<i>Samnites</i>, <i>Lucanians</i>, and other people who play a
great part in the Roman history, may perhaps be classed
together as <i>Opicans</i> or <i>Oscans</i>, in distinction from the
Latins, and the other tribes allied to them. These
tribes seem to have pressed from the eastern, the Hadriatic,
coast of Italy, down upon the nations to the
south-west of them, and to have largely extended their
borders at their expense.</p>

<p>But part of ancient Italy, and a still larger part of
Italy in the modern sense, was inhabited by nations
other than the Italians.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Iapygians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the heel of the boot were
the <i>Iapygians</i>, a people of uncertain origin, but who
seem in any case to have had a great gift of receiving
the Greek language and manners.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gauls.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And in the northern
part, in the lands which were not then counted as
part of Italy, were the <i>Gauls</i>, a Celtic people, akin
to the Gauls beyond the Alps, and whose country
was therefore called <i>Cisalpine Gaul</i> or Gaul on this
side of the Alps. They were found on both sides of the
Po, and on the Hadriatic coast they seem to have
stretched in early times almost as far south as <i>Ancona</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Veneti.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the north-east corner of Italy were yet another
people, the <i>Veneti</i>, perhaps of Illyrian origin, whose
name long after was taken by the city of <i>Venice</i>. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
during the whole time with which we have to do, there
was no city so called, and the name of <i>Venetia</i> is always
the name of a country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greek colonies
in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>All these nations we may look on as the original
inhabitants of Italy; that is, all were there before anything
like contemporary history begins.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But besides
these original nations, there were in one part of Italy
many Greek colonies, and also in the island of Sicily.
Some cities of Italy claimed to be Greek colonies, without
any clear proof that they were so. But there seems
no reason to doubt that <i>Kymê</i> or <i>Cumæ</i> on the western
coast of Italy, and <i>Ankôn</i> or <i>Ancona</i> on the Hadriatic,
were solitary Greek colonies far away from any other
Greek settlements. Cumæ, though so far off, is said to
have been the earliest Greek colony in Italy. But
where the Greeks mainly settled was in the two lesser
peninsulas, the heel and the toe of the boot, into which
the great peninsula of Italy divides at its southern end.
Here, as was before said, there is a nearer approach to
the kind of coast to which the Greeks were used at
home. Here then arose a number of Greek cities,
stretching from the extreme south almost up to Cumæ.
As in the case of the Greek cities in Asia, the time of
greatness of the Italian Greeks came earlier than that
of the Greeks in Greece itself. In the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
some of these Greek colonies in Italy, as <i>Taras</i> or
<i>Tarentum</i>, <i>Krotôn</i> or <i>Crotona</i>, <i>Sybaris</i>, and others, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
among the greatest cities of the Greek name. But, as
the Italian nations grew stronger, the Greek cities lost
their power, and many of them, Cumæ among them,
fell into the hands of Italian conquerors, and lost their
Greek character more or less thoroughly. Others
remained Greek till they became subject to Rome,
and the Greek speech and manners did not quite die
out of southern Italy till ages after the Christian æra.</p>

<p>The geography and history of the great island of
Sicily, which lies so near to the toe of the boot, cannot
be kept apart from those of Italy. The mainland and
the island were, to a great extent, inhabited by the same
nations. The <i>Sikanians</i> in the western part of the
island may not unlikely have been akin to the Ligurians
and Basques; but the <i>Sikels</i>, who gave their name
to the island, and who are the people with whom the
Greeks had most to do, were clearly of the Italian
stock, and were nearly allied to the Latins.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phœnician
and Greek
colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Phœnicians
of Carthage planted some colonies in the
western and northern parts of the island, the chief
of which was the city which the Greeks called
<i>Panormos</i>, the modern capital <i>Palermo</i>. But the
western and southern sides of the triangle were full
of Greek cities, which are said to have been founded
from the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> to the sixth. Several of
these, especially <i>Syracuse</i> and <i>Akragas</i> or <i>Agrigentum</i>,
were among the chief of Greek cities; and from them
the Greek speech and manners gradually spread themselves
over the natives, till in the end Sicily was reckoned
as wholly a Greek land. But for some centuries
Sicilian history is chiefly made up of struggles for
the mastery between Carthage and the Greek cities.
This was in truth a struggle between the Aryan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
the Semitic race, and we shall see that, many ages
after, the same battle was again fought on the same
ground.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Growth of the Roman power in Italy.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gradual
conquest of
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The history of ancient Italy, as far as we know it,
is the history of the gradual conquest of the whole land
by one of its own cities; and the changes in its political
geography are mainly the changes which followed the
gradual bringing of the whole peninsula under the
Roman dominion. But the form which the conquests
of Rome took hindered those conquests from having
so great an effect on the map as they otherwise might
have had. The cities and districts of Italy, as they were
one by one conquered by Rome, were commonly left
as separate states, in the relation of dependent alliance,
from which most of them were step by step promoted
to the rights of Roman citizenship.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Different
positions of
the Italian
cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
An Italian city
might be a dependent ally of Rome; it might be a
Roman colony with the full franchise or a colony holding
the inferior Latin franchise; or it might have been
actually made part of a Roman tribe. All these were
very important political differences; but they do not
make much difference in the look of things on the
map. The most important of the changes which can
be called strictly geographical belong to the early days
of Rome, when there were important national movements
among the various races of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Rome arose
at the point of union of the three races, Latin, Oscan,
and Etruscan, and it arose from an union between the
<i>Latin</i> and <i>Oscan</i> races.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rome a
Latin city.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Two Latin and one <i>Sabine</i>
settlements seem to have joined together to form the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
city of Rome; but the Sabine element must have been
thoroughly Latinized, and Rome must be counted as
a Latin city, the greatest, though very likely the youngest,
among the cities of Latium.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her early
Latin dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Rome, planted on a march, rose, in the way in
which marchlands often do rise, to supremacy among
her fellows. Our first authentic record of the early
commonwealth sets Rome before us as bearing rule
over the whole of Latium. This dominion she seems
to have lost soon after the driving out of the kings,
and some of her territory right of the Tiber seems
to have become Etruscan. Presently Rome appears,
no longer as mistress of Latium, but as forming one
member of a triple league concluded on equal terms
with the Latins as a body, and with the Hernicans.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wars with
her neighbours.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This league was engaged in constant wars with its
neighbours of the Oscan race, the <i>Æquians</i> and <i>Volscians</i>,
by whom many of the Latin cities were taken.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>More distant
wars.<br />
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;396.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the first great advance of Rome’s actual dominion
was made on the right bank of the Tiber,
by the
taking of the Etruscan city of <i>Veii</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;343.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Fifty years later
Rome began to engage in more distant wars; and we
may say generally that the conquest of Italy was going
on bit by bit for eighty years more.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;296.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By the end
of that time, all Italy, in the older sense, was brought
in one shape or another under the Roman dominion.
The neighbouring districts, both Latin and of other
races, had been admitted to citizenship. Roman and
Latin colonies were planted in various parts of the
country; elsewhere the old cities, Etruscan, Samnite,
Greek, or any other, still remained as dependent allies
of Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Incorporation
of
the
Italian
states.<br />
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;89.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Presently Rome went on to win dominion
out of Italy; but the Italian states still remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
their old relation to Rome,
till the Italian allies
received the Roman franchise after the <i>Social</i> or <i>Marsian</i>
war. The <i>Samnites</i> alone held out, and they
may be said to have been altogether exterminated in
the wars of Sulla. The rest of Italy was Roman.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>The Western Provinces.</i></h3>

<p>The great change in Roman policy, and in European
geography as affected by it, took place when Rome
began to win territory out of Italy. The relation of
these foreign possessions to the ruling city was quite
different from that of the Italian states. The foreign
conquests of Rome were made into <i>provinces</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nature of
the Roman
Provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A province was a district which was subject to Rome,
and put under the rule of a Roman governor, which
was not done with the dependent allies in Italy. But
it must be borne in mind that, though we speak of
a province as having a certain geographical extent,
yet there might be cities within its limits whose formal
relation to Rome was that of dependent, or even
of equal, alliance. There might also be Roman and
Latin colonies, either colonies really planted or cities
which had been raised to the Roman or Latin franchise.
All these were important distinctions as regarded
the internal government of the different states;
still practically all alike formed part of the Roman
dominion. In a geographical survey it will therefore
be enough to mark the extent of the different
provinces, without attending to their political, or
more truly municipal, distinctions, except in a few
cases where they are of special importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eastern
and Western
Provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The provinces then are the foreign dominions of
Rome, and they fall naturally into two, or rather three,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
divisions. There are the provinces of the West, in which
the Romans had chiefly to contend with nations much
less civilized than themselves, and in which therefore the
provincials gradually adopted the language and manners
of their conquerors. But in the provinces to the east
of the Hadriatic, the Greek language and Greek manners
had become the language and manners of civilized
life, and their supremacy was not supplanted by those
of Rome. And in the more distant parts, as in Syria
and Egypt, the Greek civilization was a mere varnish;
the mass of the people still kept to their old manners
and languages as they were before the Macedonian
conquests. In these countries therefore the Latin tongue
and Roman civilization made but little progress. The
Roman conquests went on on both sides of the Hadriatic
at the same time, but it was to the west that they
began. The first Roman province however forms a
sort of intermediate class by itself, standing between
the eastern and the western.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This first Roman province was formed in the great
island of <i>Sicily</i>, which, by its geographical position,
belongs to the western part of Europe, while the
fact that Greek became the prevailing language in it
rather connects it with the eastern part.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>First
Roman
possessions
in the
island.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;241.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Roman
dominion in Sicily began when the Carthaginian possessions
in the island were given up to Rome, as the result
of the first Punic war. But, as Hierôn of <i>Syracuse</i>
had helped Rome against Carthage, his kingdom remained
in alliance with Rome, and was not dealt with
as a conquered land.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Syracuse.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;212.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was only when Syracuse
turned against Rome in the second Punic war that it
was, on its conquest, formally made a Roman possession.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;132.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Eighty years later the condition of Sicily under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
Roman government was finally settled, and it may be
taken as a type of the endless variety of relations in
which the different districts and cities throughout the
Roman dominions stood to the ruling commonwealth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of
Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The greater part of the island became simply subject;
the land was held to be forfeited to the Roman People,
and the former inhabitants held it simply as tenants on
payment of a tithe. But some cities were called free,
and kept their land; others remained in name independent
allies of the Roman People. Other cities
were afterwards raised to the Latin franchise; in
others Latin or Roman colonies were planted, and
one Sicilian city, that of <i>Messana</i>, received the full
citizenship of Rome. It must be borne in mind that
these different relations, these exceptionally favoured
cities and districts, are found, not only in Sicily, but
throughout all the provinces.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greek civilization
of
Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Sicily, by the time of
the conquest, was looked on as a thoroughly Greek
land. The Greek language and manners had now
spread themselves everywhere among the Sikels and
the other inhabitants of the island. And Sicily
remained a thoroughly Greek land, till, ages afterwards,
it again became, as it had been in the days of the Greek
and Phœnician colonies, a battle-field of Aryan and
Semitic races in the days of the Mahometan conquests.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sardinia
and Corsica.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The two great islands of <i>Sardinia</i> and <i>Corsica</i>
seem almost as natural appendages to Italy as Sicily
itself; but their history is very different. They have
played no important part in the history of the world.
The original stock of their inhabitants seems to have
been akin to the non-Aryan element in Spain and Sicily.
The attempts at Greek colonization in them were but
feeble, and they passed under the dominion, first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
Carthage and then of Rome, without any important
change in their condition.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;238.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These two islands became
a Roman province, which was always reckoned one of
the most worthless of provinces, in the interval between
the first and second Punic wars.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cisalpine
Gaul.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus far the Roman dominions did not reach
beyond what we should look upon as the natural
extent of the dominion of an Italian power. Indeed,
as long as Italy did not reach to the Alps, we should
say that it had not reached the natural extent of an
Italian dominion. But the conquest of Cisalpine Gaul
cannot be separated from the general conquest of
Western Europe. The Roman conquest of Gaul and
Spain, by gradually spreading the Latin language and
Roman civilization over those countries, created two
of the chief nations and languages of modern Europe.
But the process was simply the continuation of a process
which began within the borders of what we now
call Italy. Gaul within the Alps was as strictly a
foreign conquest as Spain or as Gaul beyond the Alps.
Only the geographical position of Cisalpine Gaul allowed
it to be easily and speedily incorporated with
Italy in a way which the lands beyond the Alps could
not be. The beginnings of conquest in this direction
took place after the end of the Samnite wars.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Foundation

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;282.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then

founded on Gaulish soil, and it was presently followed
by the foundation of <i>Ariminum</i> or <i>Rimini</i>.

of Cisalpine
Gaul.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;201-191.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Roman arms were carried beyond the Po in the time
between the first and the second Punic war;
after the second Punic war, Cisalpine Gaul was thoroughly
conquered, and was secured by the foundation of many
Roman and Latin colonies.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;43.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Roman and Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
franchises were gradually extended to most parts of
the country,
and at last Cisalpine Gaul was formally
incorporated with Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
Liguria and
Venetia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Closely connected with the conquest of Cisalpine
Gaul was the conquest of the other non-Italian lands
within the boundaries of modern Italy. These were
<i>Liguria</i> to the south-east of Cisalpine Gaul and <i>Venetia</i>
to the north-west. Both these lands held out longer
than Cisalpine Gaul; but by the time of Augustus they
were all, together with the peninsula of <i>Istria</i>, counted
as part of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Foundation
of Aquileia,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;183.
<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dominion of Rome in this region
was secured at an early stage of the conquest by the
foundation of the great colony of <i>Aquileia</i>. We thus
see that, not only Venice, but Milan, Pavia, Verona,
Ravenna, and Genoa, cities which played so great a
part in the after history of Italy, arose in lands which
were not originally Italian. But we also see that Italy,
with the boundaries given to it by Augustus, took in a
somewhat larger territory to the north-east than the
kingdom of Italy does now.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The lands within the Alps may be fairly said
to have been conquered by Rome in self-defence, and
we cannot help looking on the three great islands
as natural parts of an Italian dominion. The conquests
of the Romans in lands altogether beyond their
own borders may be said to have begun in Western
Europe with the conquest of <i>Spain</i>, which began
before that of Transalpine Gaul.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Connexion

Spain and Gaul, who, when our history begins, stretched
as far into Gaul as the Garonne.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Celts.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the <i>Celts</i>, the
first wave of the Aryan migration in Europe, had
pressed into both Gaul and Spain; in Gaul they had,

far the greater part of the country.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greek and<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Mediterranean
coasts of Gaul and Spain were also connected together
by the sprinkling of Greek colonies along those shores,
of which <i>Massalia</i> was the head. And, beside the
primitive non-Aryan element, there was an intrusive
non-Aryan element also.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Phœnician

In southern Spain several
Phœnician settlements had been made, the chief of
which was <i>Gades</i> or <i>Cadiz</i>, beyond the straits, the one
great Phœnician city on the Ocean. And between the
first and second Punic wars Carthage obtained a large
Spanish dominion, of which <i>New Carthage</i> or <i>Carthagena</i>
was the capital.</p>

<p>It was the presence of these last settlements which
first brought Spain under the Roman dominion.

Meanwhile,

spreading through the country, and in Augustus’ time
southern Spain was altogether Romanized. It was
only in a small district close to the Pyrenees that
the ancient language held out, as it has done ever
since.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Transalpine

<p>The conquest of Spain, owing to the connexion of
the country with Carthage, thus began while a large
part even of Cisalpine Gaul was still unsubdued. And
the Roman arms were not carried into Gaul beyond the
Alps till the conquest of Spain was pretty well assured.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;122.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The foundation of the first Roman colony at <i>Aquæ
Sextiæ</i>, the modern <i>Aix</i>, was only eleven years later
than the fall of Numantia. The Romans stepped in as
allies of the Greek city of Massalia, and, as usual, from
helping their allies they took to conquering on their
own account.

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;125-105.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A Roman province, including the colonies

south-eastern part of Transalpine Gaul. The advance
of Rome in this direction seems to have been checked
by the invasion of the Cimbri and Teutones, but through
that long delay Roman influences were able to establish
themselves more firmly. This part of Gaul was early
and thoroughly Romanized, and part of it still keeps,
in its name of <i>Provence</i>, the memory of its having been
the first Roman province beyond the Alps. The rest
of Gaul was left untouched till the great campaigns of
Cæsar.</p>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Boundaries

Gaul.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Transalpine Gaul, as a geographical
division, has well-marked boundaries in the Mediterranean,
the Alps, the Rhine, the Ocean, and the Pyrenees.
But this geographical division has never answered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its three
divisions,
and their
inhabitants,
Iberian,
Celtic, and
German.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Gaul in Cæsar’s
day, that is Gaul beyond the Roman province, formed
three divisions—<i>Aquitaine</i> to the south-west, <i>Celtic
Gaul</i> in the middle, and <i>Belgic Gaul</i> to the north-east.
Aquitaine, stretching to the Garonne—the name was
under Augustus extended to the Loire—was Iberian,
akin to the people on the other side of the Pyrenees:
a trace of its old speech remains in the small Basque
district north of the Pyrenees. Celtic Gaul, from the
Loire to the Seine and Marne, was the most truly Celtic
land, and it was in this part of Gaul that the modern
French nation took its rise. In the third division,
Belgic Gaul, the tribes to the east, nearer to the Rhine,
were some of them purely German, and others had been
to a great extent brought under German influences or
mixed with German elements. There was, in fact, no
unity in Gaul beyond that which the Romans brought
with them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Romanization

Gaul.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In seven years Cæsar subdued the whole
land, and the work of assimilation began. The Roman
language gradually displaced all the native languages,
except where Basque and Breton survive in two
corners; but in a large part of Belgic Gaul the events
of later times brought the German tongue back again.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Permanence
of the
ancient
geography.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There is no Roman province in which, among all
changes, the ancient geography has had so much effect
upon that of all later times. In southern Gaul most
of the cities still keep their old names with very little
change. But in northern Gaul the cities have mostly
taken the names of the tribes of which they were the
heads. Thus <i>Tolosa</i> is still <i>Toulouse</i>; but <i>Lutetia
Parisiorum</i> has become <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>The lands which we have thus gone through, Cisalpine
Gaul with Liguria and Venetia, Spain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
Transalpine Gaul, form a marked division in historical
geography. They are those parts of Western Europe
which Rome conquered during the time of her Commonwealth,
and they are those parts which have
mainly kept their Roman speech to this day. But these
did not make up the whole of the lands where Rome
planted her Latin speech, at least for a while. The
conquest of Britain belongs to the days of the Empire;
but Rome, during the Commonwealth, made another
conquest, which, though not in Europe, may be counted
as belonging to the Western or Latin-speaking half of
her dominion. This is the conquest of that part of
<i>Africa</i> which Rome won as the result of her wars
with Carthage.

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;146;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The only African possession won by
Rome during the days of the Commonwealth was <i>Africa</i>
in the strictest sense, the immediate dominion of Carthage.
This became a province when the Punic wars
were ended by the destruction of Carthage.

The neighbouring state of <i>Numidia</i>, after passing, like Carthage
itself, through the intermediate state of a dependency,
was made a province by Cæsar, being
called <i>New Africa</i>, the former African province becoming
the <i>Old</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Restoration

Cæsar also restored the city of Carthage
as a Roman colony, and it became the chief
of the Latin-speaking cities of the Empire, second only
to Rome herself. But in Africa, just as in Britain,
the land never became thoroughly Romanized like
Gaul and Spain. The Roman tongue and laws therefore
died out in both lands at the first touch of an
invader, the English in one case and the Saracens in
the other. The strip of fertile land between the sea
on one side and the mountains and the Great Desert
on the other received, first Phœnician and then Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
civilization. But neither of them could really take root
there in the way that the Roman civilization took root
in Gaul and Spain.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>The Eastern Provinces.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Contrast
between the
Eastern
and Western
provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Hadriatic Sea may be roughly taken as the
boundary between the Eastern and Western parts of
the Roman dominion. In the West, the Romans carried
with them not only their arms, but their tongue,
their laws, and their manners. They were not only
conquerors but civilizers. The native Iberians and
Celts adopted Roman fashions, and the isolated Greek
and Phœnician cities, like Massalia and Gades, gradually
became Roman also. East of the Hadriatic
the state of things was quite different. Here the language
and civilization of Greece had, through the
conquests of the Macedonian kings, become everywhere
predominant.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greek civilization
in
the East.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Greek was everywhere the polite and
literary language, and a certain varnish of Greek manners
had been everywhere spread. In some parts
indeed it was the merest varnish; still it was everywhere
strong enough to withstand the influence of Latin.
Sicily and Southern Italy are the only lands which have
altogether thrown away the Greek tongue, and have
taken to Latin or any of the languages formed out of
Latin. No part of the eastern half of the Roman
dominion ever became Roman in the same way as
Gaul and Spain.</p>

<p>The whole of the lands east of the Hadriatic may
thus, as opposed to the Latin-speaking lands of the
west, be called Greek-speaking lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distinctions
among the
Eastern
provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But there
are some wide distinctions to be drawn among them.
First, there was old Greece itself and the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
colonies, and lands like <i>Epeiros</i>, which had become
thoroughly Greek. Secondly, there were the kingdoms,
like <i>Macedonia</i> in Europe and <i>Pergamos</i> in Asia, which
had adopted the Greek speech and manners, but which
did not, like Epeiros, become Greek in any political
sense. Thirdly, there were a number of native states,
<i>Bithynia</i> and others, whose kings also tried to imitate
Greek ways, but naturally could not do so as thoroughly
as the kings of Macedonia and Pergamos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lands
beyond
Tauros.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Fourthly,
beyond Mount Tauros lay the kingdoms of <i>Syria</i> and
<i>Egypt</i>, which were ruled by Macedonian kings, which
contained great Greek or Macedonian cities like <i>Antioch</i>
and <i>Alexandria</i>, but where there were native languages,
and an old native civilization, which neither Greek nor
Roman influences could ever root out. We shall see
as we go on that Tauros makes a great historical boundary.
The lands on this side of it really came, though
very gradually, under the dominion of the Greek speech
and the Roman law. Beyond Mount Tauros both the
Greek and the Roman element lay merely on the surface,
and therefore those lands, like Africa, easily fell away
when they were attacked by the Saracens.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> We must
now go through such of the lands east of the Hadriatic
as were formed into Roman provinces during the time
of the Roman Commonwealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Illyrian
Provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But again, between the Latin and the Greek parts
of the Roman dominion there was a border land,
namely, the lands held by the great <i>Illyrian</i> race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
The southern parts of Illyria came within the reach
of Greek influences, and it was through the affairs of
Illyria that Rome was first led to meddle in the affairs
of Greece.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The kingdom
of
Skodra.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The use of the name <i>Illyria</i> is at all
times very vague; as a more definite meaning
as the name of a kingdom whose capital was <i>Skodra</i>,
and which, in the second half of the third century, was
a dangerous neighbour to the Greek cities and islands
on that coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;168.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This kingdom was involved in the third
Macedonian war, and came to an end at the same time.
As usual, it is not easy to distinguish how much, if
any, of the country actually became a Roman province,
and how much was left for a while in the intermediate
state of dependent alliance. But, for all practical
purposes, the Illyrian kingdom of Skodra formed
from this time a part of the Roman dominion. With
the fall of Skodra, the parts of Illyria which lay further
to the north, beyond the bounds of the Greek world,
first came into notice.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dalmatian
Wars.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Greek colonies in Dalmatia
had played their part in the first Illyrian war;
but the land itself, which was to become an outlying
fringe of Italy lying east of the Hadriatic, is now first
heard of as a distinct country formed by a separation
from the kingdom of Skodra.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;156.<br />
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;34.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first Dalmatian
war soon followed; but it was not till after several wars
that Dalmatia became a province, and even after that
time there were several revolts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Roman
colonies in
Dalmatia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before long, Dalmatia
was settled with several Roman colonies, as <i>Jadera</i>
or <i>Zara</i>, and, above all, <i>Salona</i>, which became one of
the chief cities of the Roman dominion. The neighbouring
lands of <i>Liburnia</i>, <i>Istria</i>, and the land of the
<i>Iapodes</i>, were gradually reduced during the same
period.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Istria incorporated
with Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Istria, like the neighbouring land of Venetia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
was actually incorporated with Italy, and <i>Pola</i>, under
the name of <i>Pietas Julia</i>, became a Roman colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
outlying
Greek
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have already traced the process by which old
Greece and the neighbouring lands of Macedonia and
Epeiros gradually sank, first practically, and then formally,
into parts of the Roman dominion. It would be
hard to say at what particular moment many of the
Greek cities and islands sank from the relation of obedient
allies into that of acknowledged subjects.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their late
formal annexation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We have seen that some of them, as Rhodes and Byzantion,
were not formally annexed till the reign of Vespasian.
The Greek cities on the Euxine do not seem to have
been formally annexed at all till a late period of the
Eastern Empire. Other outlying Greek lands and cities
became so mixed up with the history of some of the
Asiatic kingdoms that they will come in for a mention
along with them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Crete,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;67,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Crete</i> kept its independence to
become a nest of pirates, and to be specially conquered.
It then formed one province with the then
recent conquest of <i>Kyrênê</i>, the one great Greek settlement
in Africa, which had become an appanage of the
Macedonian kings of Egypt. The same had been the
fate of <i>Cyprus</i>, an island which had always been
partly Greek, and which had been further Hellenized
under its Macedonian kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of Cyprus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;58.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Cyprus too became a
province. Thus, before Rome lost her own freedom,
she had become the formal or practical mistress of
all the earlier abodes of freedom. Men could not yet
foresee that a time would come when <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Roman</i> should be words having the same meaning,
and when the place and name of Rome herself should
be transferred to one of the Greek cities which Vespasian
formally reduced from alliance to bondage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Asiatic
Provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In Roman history one war and one conquest
always led to another, and, as the affairs of Illyria had
led to Roman interference in Greece, so the affairs of
Greece led to Roman interference in <i>Asia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;191-188.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first
war which Rome waged with <i>Antiochos</i> of Syria led to
no immediate increase of the Roman territory, but all
the Seleukid possessions on this side Tauros were divided
among the allies of Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Province
of Asia.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;133-129.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This, as usual, was the
first step towards the conquest of Asia, and it is quite
according to the usual course of things that the first
Roman province beyond the Ægæan, the province of
<i>Asia</i>, was formed of the dominions of Rome’s first and
most useful allies, the kings of Pergamos. The mission
of Alexander and his successors, as the representatives
of Western civilization against the East, now passed
into the hands of Rome. Step by step, the other lands
west of Tauros came under the formal or practical dominion
of Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bithynia.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;74.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Bithynia</i> was the first to be annexed,
and this acquisition was one of the causes which led to
the second war between Rome and the famous <i>Mithridates</i>
of <i>Pontos</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Overthrow
of Mithridates.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;64.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
His final overthrow brought a number
of other lands under Roman dominion or influence.
The Greek cities of <i>Sinôpê</i> and <i>Hêrakleia</i> obtained a
nominal freedom, and vassal kings went on reigning in
part of Pontos itself, and in the distant Greek kingdom
of <i>Bosporos</i>. Rome was now mistress of Asia Minor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lykia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The land was divided among her provinces and her
vassal kings, save that the wise federal commonwealth
of <i>Lykia</i> still kept the highest amount of independence
which was consistent with the practical supremacy of
Rome.</p>

<p>The Mithridatic war, which made Rome mistress of
Asia in the narrower sense, at once involved her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
the affairs of the further East. Tigranes of <i>Armenia</i>
had been the chief ally of Mithridates; but, though
his power was utterly humbled, no Armenian province
was added to the Roman dominion for a long
time to come.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Province
of Syria.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;64.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the remnant of the Seleukid
monarchy became the Roman province of <i>Syria</i>. As
usual, several cities and principalities were allowed
to remain in various relations of alliance and dependence
on the ruling commonwealth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Palestine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among these
we find <i>Judæa</i> and the rest of <i>Palestine</i>, sometimes
under a Roman procurator, sometimes united under
a single vassal king, sometimes parted out among various
kings and tetrarchs, as suited the momentary
caprice or policy of Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
with British
India.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In all these various relations
between the native states and the ruling city we
have a lively foreshadowing of the relations between
England and the subject and dependent princes of
India.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rome the
champion
of the West.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The conquests of Rome in these regions made her
more distinctly than ever the sole representative of the
West against the East, and these conquests presently
brought her into collision with the one power in the
known world which could at all meet her on equal
terms. She had stepped into the place of Alexander
and Seleukos so far as that all those parts of Alexander’s
Asiatic conquests which had received even
a varnish of Hellenic culture had become parts of her
dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her rivalry
with Parthia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The further East beyond the Euphrates
was again under the command of a great barbarian
power, that of <i>Parthia</i>, which had stepped into the
place of Persia, as Rome had stepped into the place of
Greece and Macedonia. Rome had now again a rival,
in a sense from which she had not had a rival since
the overthrow of Carthage and Macedonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p>One only of the Macedonian kingdoms now remained
to be gathered in.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Egypt.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;31.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The annexation of <i>Egypt</i>,
an annexation made famous by the names of Kleopatra,
Antonius, the elder and the younger Cæsar, completed
the work. Rome was now fully mistress of her own
civilized world. Her dominion took in all the lands
round the great inland sea. If, here and there, her
formal dominion was broken by a city or principality
whose nominal relation was that of alliance, the distinction
concerned only the local affairs of that city or
principality.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><i>Pax Romana.</i><span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Within the whole historic world of the
three ancient continents, the Roman Peace had begun.
Rome had still to wage wars, and even to annex provinces;
but those wars and annexations were now done
rather to round off and to strengthen the territory
which had been already gained, than in the strictest
sense to extend it.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>Conquests under the Empire.</i></h3>

<p>At the same moment when the Roman commonwealth
was practically changed into a monarchy, the
Roman dominion was thus brought, not indeed to
its greatest extent, but to an extent of which its further
extension was only a natural completion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
under Augustus
and
Tiberius.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There
seems a certain inconsistency when we find Augustus
laying down a rule against the enlargement of
the Empire, while the Empire was, during his reign
and that of his successor, extended in every direction.
But the conquests of this time were mainly
conquests for the purpose of strengthening the frontier;
the occasional changes of this and that city
or district from the dependent to the provincial
relation, or sometimes from the provincial to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
dependent, are now hardly worth mentioning.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Incorporation
of the
dependent
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Between
Augustus and Nero, or, at all events, between
Augustus and Vespasian, all the dependent states in
Asia and Africa, such as <i>Mauritania</i>, <i>Kappadokia</i>,
<i>Lykia</i>, and others, were finally incorporated with the
Empire to which they had long been practically subject.
These annexations can hardly be called conquests.
And it was merely finishing a work which had
been begun two hundred years before, when the small
corner of Spain which still kept its independence was
brought under the Roman power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Strengthening
of the
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The real conquests
of this time consisted in the strengthening of the European
frontier. No frontier nearer than the Rhine and
the Danube could be looked on as safe. This lesson
was easily learned; but it had also to be accompanied
by another lesson which taught that the Rhine and the
Danube, and no more distant points, were to be the
real frontiers of Rome.</p>

<p>This brings us both to the lands which were then our
own and to the lands which became our own in after
times. During the reign of Augustus two conquests
which most nearly concern our own history were
planned, and one of them was attempted. The annexation
of the land which was to become England
was talked of; the annexation of the land which then
was England, along with the rest of the German
lands, was seriously attempted. But the conquest
of Britain was put off from the days of Augustus to
the days of Claudius.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Attempted
conquest
of Germany.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;11-<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;
9.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The attempt at the conquest
of Germany, which was deemed to have been already
carried out, was shivered when Arminius overthrew
the legions of Varus.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;19.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The expeditions of Drusus and
Germanicus into Northern Germany must have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
the Roman armies into contact with our own forefathers,
for the first time, and, for several ages, for the
last time. But from this time the relations between Rome
and southern Germany begin, and constantly increase in
importance. The two great rivers were fixed as a real
frontier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
on the Danube.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The lands between the Alps and the Danube,
<i>Rætia</i>, <i>Vindelicia</i>, <i>Noricum</i>, <i>Pannonia</i>, with <i>Mœsia</i> on
the lower Danube, were all added to the Empire during
the reign of Augustus. These were strictly defensive
annexations, annexations made in order to remove the
dangerous frontier further from Italy. Beyond the Rhine
and the Danube the Roman possessions were mere outposts
held for the defence of the land between the two
great streams.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Attempt
on Arabia.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;24.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile, while the attempt of the conquest of
Germany came to so little, an attempt at conquest
at the other end of the world, in the <i>Arabian</i> peninsula,
came to even less.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thrace.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It marks the policy of Rome
and the gradual nature of her advance that, while
these more distant conquests were made or attempted,
<i>Thrace</i> still retained her dependent princes, the only
land of any extent within the European dominions
of Rome which did so. But Thrace, surrounded by
Roman provinces, was in no way dangerous; it might
remain a dependency while more distant lands were
incorporated. It was not till uniformity was more
sought after, till, under Vespasian, the nominal freedom
of so many cities and principalities came to an end,
that Thrace became a province.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation
of Byzantion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was then that,
among her latest formal acquisitions in Europe, Rome
annexed the city which was, in the course of ages, to
take her own place and name.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus, in the days between Augustus and Trajan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
the conquests which Rome actually made were mainly
of a defensive and strengthening character. To this
rule there is one and only one exception of any importance.
This is the annexation to the Roman world of
the land which was looked on as another world, the
conquest of the greater part of the Isle of <i>Britain</i>.
But Britain, though it did not come under the same
law as the defensive annexations of Rætia and Pannonia,
was naturally suggested by the annexation of
Gaul and by the visits of the first Cæsar to the island.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Claudius.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;43.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
No actual conquest however took place till the reign
of Claudius.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Agricola.
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>&nbsp;84.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Forty years later the Roman conquests
in Britain were pushed by <i>Agricola</i> as far as the isthmus
between the friths of Forth and Clyde, the boundary
marked by the later rampart of <i>Antoninus</i>. But the
lasting boundary of the Roman dominion in Britain cannot
be looked on as reaching beyond the line of the
southern wall of <i>Hadrian</i>, <i>Severus</i>, and <i>Stilicho</i>, between
the Solway and the mouth of the Tyne. The northern
part of Britain thus remained unconquered, and the
conquest of Ireland was not even attempted. For us
the conquest of the land which afterwards became our
own has an interest above all the other conquests of
Rome. But it is a purely geographical interest. The
British victories of Cæsar and Agricola were won,
not over our own forefathers, but over those Celtic
Britons whom our forefathers more thoroughly swept
away. The history of our own nation is still for some
ages to be looked for by the banks of the Elbe and
the Weser, not by those of the Severn and the
Thames.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern
conquests
of Trajan.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Britain was the last to be won of the Western provinces
of Rome, and the first to be lost. Still it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
for more than three hundred years, thoroughly incorporated
with the Empire, and its loss did not happen
till that general break-up of the Empire of which its
loss was the first stage. But between the conquest of
Britain and its loss there was a short time in which
Rome again extended her dominion in the old fashion,
both in Europe and Asia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Trajan.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;98-117.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This was during the reign of
Trajan, when the Roman borders were again widely extended
in both Europe and Asia. Under him the Danube
ceased to be a boundary stream in one continent and
the Euphrates in the other.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>His Asiatic
and European
conquests.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But a marked distinction
must be drawn between his Asiatic and his European
warfare. Trajan’s Asiatic conquests were strictly momentary;
they were at once given up by his successor;
and they will be better dealt with when we speak in
another chapter of the long strife between Rome and
her Eastern rival, first Parthian and then Persian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Arabia
Petræa.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;106.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
only lasting Asiatic conquest of Trajan’s reign was not
made by Trajan himself, namely the small Roman
province in Northern <i>Arabia</i>.</p>

<p>The European conquests of Trajan stand on another
ground. If not strictly defensive, like those of Augustus,
they might easily seem to be so.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dacia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>Dacians</i>, to
the north of the lower Danube, were really threatening
to the Roman power in those regions, and they
had dealt Rome more than one severe blow in the days
of Domitian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;106.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Trajan now formed the lands between
the Thiess and the Danube, the Dniester and the

<i>Dacia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;270.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The last province to be won was the first
to be given up; for Aurelian withdrew from it, and
transferred its name to the Mœsian land immediately
south of the Danube. But if Dacia was in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
one of the most short lived of Roman conquests, it was
in another way one of the most lasting.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Later history
of
Dacia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Cut off, as it
has been for so many ages, from all Roman influences,
forming, as it has done, one of the great highways of
barbarian migration, a large part of Dacia, namely
the modern Rouman principality, still keeps its Roman
language no less than Spain and Gaul. In one way
the land is to this day more Roman than Spain or
Gaul, as its people still call themselves by the Roman
name. Dacia, in fact, though geographically belonging
to the Eastern half of the Empire, stood in the same
position as the Western provinces. Greek influences
had not reached so far north, nor was there in Dacia
any old-standing native civilization, such as there was
in Syria and Egypt. There was therefore nothing that
was at all able to hold up against Roman influences.
The land was speedily and thoroughly Romanized, and
it remains Roman in speech and name sixteen hundred
years after the withdrawal of the Roman power.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Summary.<span class="sne">♦</span></span></p>

<p>The Roman Empire was thus gradually formed
by bringing, first Italy and then the whole of the Mediterranean
lands, under the dominion of the one Roman
city. In every part of that dominion the process
of conquest was gradual. The lands which became
Roman provinces passed through various stages of alliance
and dependence before they were fully incorporated.
But, in the end, all the civilized world of those times
became Roman. Speaking roughly, three great rivers,
the Rhine, Danube, and Euphrates, formed the European
and Asiatic boundaries of the Empire. In Africa
the Roman dominion consisted only of the strip of
fertile land between the Mediterranean and the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
and deserts. Britain and Dacia, the only two
great provinces lying beyond this range, were the
last conquered and the first given up. In Western
Europe and in Africa Rome carried her language and
her civilization with her, and in those lands the Roman
speech still remains, except where it has been swept
away by Teutonic and Saracen conquests. In the
lands from the Hadriatic to Mount Tauros, which had
been brought more or less under Greek influences, the
Greek speech and civilization stood its ground, and in
those lands Greek still survives wherever it has not
been swept away by Slavonic and Turkish conquests.
In the further east, in Syria and Egypt, where there
was an old native civilization, neither Greek nor Roman
influences took real root. The differences between
these three parts of the Roman Empire, the really
Roman, the Greek, and the Oriental, will be clearly
seen as we go on.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE DISMEMBERMENT OF THE EMPIRE.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>The Later Geography of the Empire.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Roman dominion, as we have seen, grew up by the
successive annexation of endless kingdoms, districts, and
cities, each of which, after its annexation, still retained,
whether as an allied province or a subject state, much of
the separate being which it had while it was independent.
The allies and subjects of Rome remained in a variety
of different relations to the ruling city, and the old
names and the old geographical boundaries were largely
preserved.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wiping out
of old
divisions
under the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, as the old ideas of the commonwealth
gradually died out, and as the power of the Emperors
gradually grew into an avowed monarchy, the political
change naturally led to a geographical change. The
Roman dominion ceased to be a collection of allied and
subject states under a single ruling city; it changed
into a single Empire, all whose parts, all whose inhabitants,
were equally subject to its Imperial head. The
old distinctions of Latins, Italians, and provincials died
out when all free inhabitants of the Empire became
alike Romans. Italy had no longer any privilege; it
was simply part of the Empire, like any other part.
The geographical divisions which had been, first independent,
then dependent states, sank into purely administrative
divisions, which might be mapped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
afresh at any time when it was found convenient to
do so. Italy itself, in the extended sense which the
word Italy had then come to bear, was mapped out
afresh into <i>regions</i> as early as the time of Augustus.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New division
of Italy
under Augustus.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These divisions, eleven in number, mark an epoch in
the process by which the detached elements out of
which the Roman Empire had grown were fused together
into one whole. As long as Italy was a collection
of separate commonwealths, standing in various
relations to the ruling city, there could not be any
systematic division of the country for administrative
purposes. Now that the whole of Italy stood on one
level of citizenship or of subjection, the land might
be mapped out in whatever way was most convenient.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The eleven
Regions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the eleven regions of Augustus did not work
any violent change. Old names and old boundaries
largely remained. The famous names of <i>Etruria</i>,
<i>Latium</i>, <i>Samnium</i>, <i>Umbria</i>, <i>Picenum</i>, and <i>Lucania</i>
still lived on, though not always with their ancient
boundaries. And, though all the land as far as the
Alps was now Italy, two of the divisions of Italy
kept their ancient names of <i>Gaul on this side the
Po</i> and <i>Gaul beyond the Po</i>. <i>Liguria</i> and <i>Venetia</i>,
now Italian lands, make up the remainder of Northern
Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Divisions
under Constantine.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Italy had thus been mapped out afresh; what was
done with Italy in the time of Augustus was done
with the whole Empire in the time of Constantine.
What Italy was in the earlier time the whole Empire
was in the later; the old distinctions had been wiped
out, and the whole of the Roman world stood ready to
be parted out into fresh divisions. Under Diocletian, the
Empire was divided into four parts, forming the realms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
of the four Imperial colleagues of his system, the two
Augusti and their subordinate Cæsars.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division of
the Empire
under Diocletian.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;292.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Diocletian’s
system of government involved a practical degradation
of Rome from the headship of the Empire.
Augusti and Cæsars now dwelled at points where
their presence was more needed to ward off Persian
and German attacks from the frontiers; Rome was forsaken
for Nikomêdeia and Milan, for Antioch, York,
and Trier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reunion

Division
between
the sons of
Theodosius.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;395.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The division between the four Imperial
colleagues lasted under another form after the Empire
was re-united under Constantine,
and it formed the
groundwork of the more lasting division of the Empire
into East and West, between the sons of Theodosius.
The whole Empire was now mapped out according to a
scheme in which ancient geographical names were largely
preserved, but in which they were for the most part used
in new or, at least, extended meanings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Four
Prætorian
Prefectures.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Empire was
divided into four great divisions called Prætorian <i>Prefectures</i>.
These were divided into <i>Dioceses</i>—a name
used in this nomenclature without regard to the ecclesiastical
sense which was borrowed from it—and the dioceses
again into <i>Provinces</i>. The four great prefectures
of the <i>East</i>, <i>Illyricum</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and <i>Gaul</i>, answer nearly
to the fourfold division under Diocletian; while we may
say that, in the final division, Illyricum and the East
formed the Eastern Empire, and Italy and Gaul formed
the Western. But it is only roughly that either the prefectures
or their smaller divisions answer to any of
the great national or geographical landmarks of earlier
times.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prefecture
of the East.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Prefecture of the <i>East</i> is that one among the four
which least answers to anything in earlier geography,
natural or historical. Its boundaries do not answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
those of any earlier dominion, nor yet to any great
division of race or language. It stretched into all the
three continents of the old world, and took in all those
parts of the Empire which were never fully brought
under either Greek or Roman influences. But it also
took in large tracts which we have learned to look on
as part of the Hellenic world—not only lands which
had been, to a great extent, Hellenized in later times,
but even some of the earliest Greek colonies. The four
dioceses into which the Prefecture was divided formed
far more natural divisions than the Prefecture itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dioceses of
the East,<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Three of these were Asiatic. The first, specially called
the <i>East</i>, took in all the possessions of Rome beyond
Mount Tauros, together with Isauria, Kilikia, and the
island of Cyprus. Its eastern boundaries naturally
fluctuated according as Rome or Persia prevailed on
the Euphrates and the Tigris, fluctuations of which we
shall have again to speak more specially.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Egypt,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The diocese
of <i>Egypt</i>, besides Egypt in the elder sense, took in,
under the name of <i>Libya</i>, the old Greek land of the
Kyrenaic Pentapolis.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Asia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The diocese of <i>Asia</i>, a reminder
of the elder province of that name and of the kingdom
of Pergamos out of which it grew, took in the Asiatic
coasts of the Ægæan, together with Pamphylia, Lykia,
and the Ægæan Islands. The diocese of <i>Pontos</i>, preserving
the name of the kingdom of Mithridates, took
in the lands on the Euxine, with the fluctuating Armenian
possessions of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Diocese of
Thrace.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Besides these Asiatic lands, the Eastern Prefecture
contained one European diocese, that of <i>Thrace</i>,
which took in the lands stretching from the Propontis to
the Lower Danube. The names of two of its provinces
are remarkable. Rome now boasts of a province of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
<i>Scythia</i>. But, among the varied uses of that name,
it has now shrunk up to mean the land immediately
south of the mouths of the Danube.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Province of
<i>Europa</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The other name
is <i>Europa</i>, a name which, as a Roman province, means
the district immediately round the New Rome. Constantine
had now fixed his capital on the site of the old
Byzantion, the site from which the city on the Bosporos
might seem to bear rule over two worlds. With
whatever motive, the name of Europe was specially
given to that corner of the Western continent where it
comes nearest to the Eastern. Nor was the name ill-chosen
for the district round the city which was so long
to be the bulwark of Europe against invading Asia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Great cities
of the
Eastern
Prefecture.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, besides the New Rome, this Prefecture, as containing
those parts of the Empire which had belonged
to the great Macedonian kingdoms, contained an unusual
proportion of the great cities of the world. Besides a
crowd of less famous places, it took in the two great
Eastern seats of Grecian culture, the most renowned
Alexandria and the most renowned Antioch, themselves
only the chief among many others cities bearing
the same names. All these, it should be remarked,
were comparatively recent creations, bearing the names
of individual men. That cities thus artificially called into
being should have kept the position which still belonged
to the great Macedonian capitals is one of the most speaking
signs of the effect which the dominion of Alexander
and his successors had on the history of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prefecture
of Illyricum.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The nomenclature of the second Prefecture marks
how utterly Greece, as a country and nation, had died
out of all reckoning. The Prefecture of the Eastern
<i>Illyricum</i> answered roughly to European Greece and its
immediate neighbours. It took in the lands stretching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
from the Danube to the southern point of Peloponnêsos.
Greece, as part of the Roman Empire, was included
under the name of the barbarian land through which
Rome was first brought into contact with Greek affairs.
She was further included under the name of the half-barbarian
neighbour who had become Greek through
the process of conquering Greece. In the system of
Prefectures, Greece formed part of Macedonia, and
Macedonia formed part of Illyricum. So low had
Greece, as a land, fallen at the very moment when her
tongue was making the greatest of all its conquests,
when a Greek city was raised to the rank of another
Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dioceses of
Macedonia
and Dacia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Illyrian Prefecture contained the two dioceses
of <i>Macedonia</i> and <i>Dacia</i>. This last name, it will be
remembered, had, since the days of Aurelian, withdrawn
to the south of the Danube. The Macedonian diocese
contained six provinces, among which, besides the familiar
and venerable names of Macedonia and Epeiros, we
find the names, still more venerable and familiar, of
<i>Thessaly</i> and <i>Crete</i>. And one yet greater name lives
on with them. <i>Hellas</i> and <i>Græcia</i> have alike vanished
from the map; but the most abiding name in Grecian
history, the theme of Homer and the theme of Polybios,
has not perished.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Province of
Achaia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among all changes, <i>Achaia</i> is there
still.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prefecture
of Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the new system Italy and Rome herself were in
no way privileged over the rest of the Empire. The
<i>Italian</i> Prefecture took in Italy itself and the lands
which might be looked on as necessary for the defence
and maintenance of Italy. It took in the defensive
conquests of the early Empire on the Upper Danube,
and it took in the granary of Italy, Africa. Its three dioceses
were <i>Italy</i>, <i>Illyricum</i>, and <i>Africa</i>. Here Illyricum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
strangely gave its name both to a distinct Prefecture
and to one diocese of the Prefecture of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dioceses of
Italy,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Italian diocese contained seventeen provinces. The
Gaulish name has now wholly vanished from the lands
south of the Alps. The lands between the older and
the newer boundaries of Italy are now divided into
<i>Liguria</i> and <i>Venetia</i>—the former name being used in a
widely extended sense—and the new names of <i>Æmilia</i>
and <i>Flaminia</i>, provinces named after the great Roman
roads, as the roads themselves were named after Roman
magistrates. But the new Italy has spread beyond the
Alps, and reaches to the Danube. Two Rætian provinces
form part of it. Three other provinces are
formed by the three great islands, Sicily, Sardinia, and
Corsica.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Illyricum,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The diocese of the <i>Western Illyricum</i> took in
<i>Pannonia</i>, <i>Dalmatia</i>, and <i>Noricum</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Africa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The union of these lands with
Italy may seem less strange when we remember that

was the greatest of Latin-speaking cities after Rome
herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prefecture
of Gaul.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The fourth Prefecture took in the Roman dominions

Among the seven provinces of <i>Spain</i>
are reckoned, not only the Balearic islands, a natural
appendage to the Spanish peninsula, but a small part
of the African continent, the province of <i>Tingitana</i>,
stretching from the now Italian Africa to the Ocean.
This was according to the general law by which, in
almost all periods of history, either the masters of Spain
have borne rule in Africa or the masters of Africa have
borne rule in Spain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Diocese of

The diocese of <i>Gaul</i>, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
seventeen provinces, keeps, at least in name, the
boundaries of the old Transalpine land. It still numbers
the two Germanies west of the Rhine among
its provinces.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The five provinces of the diocese of

beginning to fall asunder, a greater territory than
Rome had held in the island in the days of her
greatest power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Province of

The exploits of the elder Theodosius,

sea, for a moment added to the Empire a province
beyond the wall of Antoninus, which, in honour of the
reigning Emperors Valentinian and Valens, received the
name of <i>Valentia</i>.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>The Division of the Empire.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Change in
the position
of Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The mapping out of the Empire into Prefectures,
and its division between two or more Imperial colleagues,
led naturally to its more lasting division into
what were practically two Empires. The old state
of things had altogether passed away. Rome was
no longer the city ruling over subject states. From
the Ocean to the Euphrates all was alike, if not Rome,
at least <i>Romania</i>; all its inhabitants were equally Romans.
But to be a Roman now meant, no longer to be
a citizen of a commonwealth, but to be the subject of an
Emperor. The unity of the Empire was not broken
by the division of its administration between several
Imperial colleagues; but Rome ceased to be the only
Imperial dwelling-place, and, from the latter years of
the third century, it ceased to be an Imperial dwelling-place
at all. As long as Rome held her old place, no
lasting division, nothing more than an administrative
partition among colleagues, could be thought of. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
could be no division to mark on the map. But, when
the new system had fully taken root at the end of the
fourth century, we come to a division which was comparatively
lasting, one which fills an important place in
history, and which is capable of being marked on the
map.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division of
the Empire
between the
sons of
Theodosius.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;395.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the death of Theodosius the Great, the
Empire was divided between his two sons, Arcadius
taking the Eastern provinces, answering nearly to the
Prefectures of the East and of Illyricum, while Honorius
took the Western provinces, the Prefectures of Italy and
Gaul. Through the greater part of the fifth century,
the successors of Arcadius and of Honorius formed
two distinct lines of Emperors, of whom the Eastern
reigned at Constantinople, the Western most commonly
at Ravenna. But as the dominions of each prince were
alike Roman, the Eastern and Western Emperors were
still looked on in theory as Imperial colleagues charged
with the administration of a common Roman dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Practically
two Empires.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Practically however the dominions of the two Emperors
may be looked on as two distinct Empires, the
Eastern having its seat at the New Rome or Constantinople,
while the Western had its seat more commonly
at Ravenna than at the Old Rome.</p>

<p>This division of the Empire is the great political
feature of the fifth century; but the fate of the two
Empires was widely different.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Enemies of
Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From the very beginning
of the Empire, Rome had had to struggle with
two chief enemies, in the East and in the West, in
Europe and in Asia, the nature of whose warfare was
widely different.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivalry
with Parthia
and
Persia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the East she had, first the Parthian
and then the regenerate Persian, as strictly a rival
power on equal terms. This rivalry went on from the
moment when Rome stepped into the place of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
Seleukids till the time when Rome was cut short, and
Persia overthrown, by the Saracenic invasions. But,
except during the momentary conquests of Trajan and
during the equally momentary alternate conquests of
Rome and Persia in the seventh century, the whole
strife was a mere border warfare which did not threaten
the serious dismemberment of either power. This and
that fortress was taken and retaken; this and that
province was ceded and ceded back again; but except
under Trajan and again under Chosroes and Heraclius,
the existence and dominion of neither power was ever
seriously threatened.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivalry
with Persia
passes on to
the Eastern
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Eastern Empire naturally
inherited this part of the calling of the undivided
Empire, the long strife with Persia.</p>

<p>At the other end of the Empire, the enemy was of
quite another kind.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Teutonic
incursions
in the
Western
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The danger there was through the
incursions of the various Teutonic nations. There was
no one Teutonic power which could be a rival to Rome
in the same sense in which Persia was in the East;
but a crowd of independent Teutonic tribes were
pressing into the Empire from all quarters, and were
striving to make settlements within its borders. The
task of resisting these incursions fell of course to the
Western Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>No Teutonic
settlements
in
the Eastern
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Eastern Empire indeed was
often traversed by wandering Teutonic nations; but no
permanent settlements were made within its borders,
no dismemberment of its provinces capable of being
marked on the map was made till a much later time.
But the Western Empire was altogether dismembered
and broken in pieces by the settlement of the Teutonic
nations within it. The geographical aspects of the two
Empires during the fifth century are thus strikingly
unlike one another; but each continues one side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
history of the undivided Empire. It will therefore be
well to trace those two characteristic aspects of the
two Empires separately. We will first speak of the Teutonic
incursions, through which in the end the Western
Empire was split up and the states of modern Europe
were founded. We will then trace the geographical
aspect of the long rivalry between Rome and Persia in
the East.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>The Teutonic Settlements within the Empire.</i></h3>

<p>Our subject is historical geography, and neither
ethnology nor political history, except so far as either
national migrations or political changes produce a directly
geographical effect.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Wandering
of
the Nations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great movement called
the Wandering of the Nations, and its results in the
settlement of various Teutonic nations within the
bounds of the Roman Empire, concern us now only so
far as they wrought a visible change on the map. The
exact relations of the different tribes to one another,
the exact course of the migrations which led to the
final settlement of each, belong rather to another branch
of inquiry. But there are certain marked stages in
the relations of the Empire to the nations beyond
its borders, certain marked stages in the growth and
mutual relations of those nations, which must be borne
in mind in order to explain their settlements within
the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes in
the nomenclature
of
the Teutonic
nations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It will be at once seen that the geography
and nomenclature of the German nations in
the third century is for the most part quite different
from their geography and nomenclature as we find
it in Cæsar and Tacitus. New names have come
to the front, names all of which play a part in history,
many of which remain to this day; and, with one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
two exceptions, the older names sink into the background.
It is therefore hardly needful to go through
the ethnology and geography of Tacitus, or to deal
with any of the controverted points which are suggested
thereby. We have to look at the German nations
purely in their relations to Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Warfare on
the Rhine
and the
Danube.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have seen that the history of Rome in her
western provinces was, from an early stage of the
Empire, a struggle with the Teutonic nations on the
Rhine and the Danube. We have seen that all attempts
at serious conquest beyond those boundaries
came to nothing.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Roman
possessions
beyond
those
rivers.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Roman possessions beyond the
two great rivers were mere outposts for the better
security of the land within the rivers. The district
beyond them, fenced in by a wall and known as the
<i>Agri Decumates</i>, was hardly more than such an outlying
post on a great scale. The struggle along the
border was, almost from the beginning, a defensive
struggle on the part of Rome. We hear of Roman
conquests from the second century to the fifth; but
they are strictly defensive conquests, the mere recovery
of lost possessions, or at most the establishment of
fresh outposts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formation
of confederacies
among the
Germans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From the moment of the first appearance
of Rome on the two rivers, the Teutonic nations
were really threatening to Rome, and the warfare of
Rome was really defensive; and from the very beginning
too a process seems to have been at work
among the German nations themselves which greatly
strengthened their power as enemies of Rome. New
nations or confederacies, bearing, for the most part,
names unknown to earlier times, begin to be far more
dangerous than the smaller and more scattered tribes
of the earlier times had been. These movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
among the German nations themselves, hastened by
pressure of other nations to the east of them, caused
the Teutonic attacks on the Empire to become more
and more formidable, and at last to grow into Teutonic
settlements within the Empire. But, in the course of
this process, several stages may be noticed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marcomanni
and
Quadi.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus the
<i>Marcomanni</i> and the <i>Quadi</i> play a part in this history
from the very beginning. The Marcomanni appear in
Cæsar, and, from their name of <i>Markmen</i>, we may be
sure that they were a confederacy of the same kind as
the later confederacies of the Franks and Alemanni.
In the first and second centuries the Marcomanni are
dangerous neighbours, threatening the Empire and
often penetrating beyond its borders, and their name
appears in history as late as the fifth century. But they
play no part in the Teutonic settlements within the
Empire. They do not affect the later map; they had
no share in bringing about the changes out of which
modern Europe arose. Their importance ceases just at
the time when a second stage begins, when, in the
course of the third century, we begin to hear of those
nations or confederacies whose movements really did
affect later history and geography.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning

modern Europe begins.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The new
confederacies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We now begin to hear names
which have been heard ever since, <i>Franks</i>, <i>Alemans</i>,
<i>Saxons</i>, all of them great confederacies of German
tribes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Defensive
warfare of
Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Defence against German inroads now becomes
the chief business of the rulers of Rome. The invaders
were constantly driven back; but new invaders were
as constantly found to renew their incursions. Men of
Teutonic race pressed into the Empire in every conceivable
character.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Germans
within the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides open enemies, who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
with the hope either of plunder or settlement, crowds
of Germans served in the Roman armies and obtained
lands held by military tenure as the reward of their
services. Their chiefs were promoted to every rank
and honour, military and civil, short of the Imperial
dignity itself. These were changes of the utmost
importance in other points of view; still they do not
directly affect the map of the Empire. Lands and
cities were won and lost over and over again; but such
changes were merely momentary; the acknowledged
boundaries of the Roman dominion were not yet
altered; it is not till the next stage that geography
begins to be directly concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning
of national
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">This last stage begins with the early years of the
fifth century, and thus nearly coincides with the division
of the Empire into East and West. Gothic and
other Teutonic kings could now march at pleasure at
the head of their armies through every corner of the
Empire, sometimes bearing the titles of Roman officers,
sometimes dictating the choice of Roman Emperors,
sometimes sacking the Old Rome or threatening the
New. It was when these armies under their kings
settled down and formed national kingdoms within the
limits of the Empire, that the change comes to have an
effect on the map. In the course of the fifth century
the Western provinces of Rome were rent away from
her. In most cases the loss was cloaked by some Imperial
commission, some empty title bestowed on the
victorious invader; but the Empire was none the less
practically dismembered. Out of these dismemberments
the modern states of Europe gradually grew. It
will now be our business to give some account of
those nations, Teutonic and otherwise, who had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
immediate share in this work, passing lightly by all
questions, and indeed all nations, which cannot be said
to have had such an immediate share in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Teutonic
Settlements
in
the West.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="p2">The nations which in the fourth and fifth centuries
made settlements in the Western provinces of Rome
fall under two chief heads; those who made their settlements
by land, and those who made them by sea.
This last class is pretty well coextensive with the
settlement of our own forefathers in Britain, which
must be spoken of separately.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlements
within the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among the others, the
nations who play an important part in the fourth and
fifth centuries are the <i>Goths</i>, the <i>Vandals</i>, the <i>Burgundians</i>,
the <i>Suevi</i>, and the <i>Franks</i>. And their settlements
again fall into two classes, those which passed
away within a century or two, and those which have
had a lasting effect on European history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Franks,
Burgundians,
Suevi,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus it
is plain at the first glance that the Franks and the
Burgundians have left their names on the modern
map. The Suevi have left their name also: but it is
now found only in their older German land; it has
vanished for ages from their western settlement.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Goths,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
name of the Goths has passed away from the kingdoms
which they founded, but their presence has affected the
history of both the Spanish and the Italian peninsulas.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Vandals.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Vandals alone, as a nation and kingdom, have
left no traces whatever, though it may be that they
have left their name to a part of one of the lands
of their sojourn.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All these nations founded kingdoms
within the Western Empire, kingdoms which at first
admitted a nominal superiority in the Empire, but
which were practically independent from the beginning.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Various
circumstances
of
their history.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the history of the several kingdoms is very different.
Some of them soon passed away altogether, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
others became the beginnings of the great nations
of modern Europe. Gaul and Spain fell off very
gradually from the Empire. But, in the course of the
fifth century, all the nations of which we have been
speaking formed more or less lasting settlements within
those provinces. Pre-eminent among them are the great
settlements of the Goths and the Franks. Out of the
settlement of the Franks arose the modern kingdoms
of Germany and France, and out of the settlement of
the Goths arose the various kingdoms of Spain. Those
of the Burgundians, Vandals, and Suevi were either
smaller or less lasting. All of them however must be
mentioned in their order.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Migrations
of the
West-Goths.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>First and greatest come the <i>Goths</i>. It is not needful
for our purpose to examine all that history or legend
has to tell us as to the origin of the Goths, or all
the theories which ingenious men have formed on
the subject.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Defeat of
the Goths
by Claudius.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;269.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is enough for our purpose that the
Goths began to show themselves as dangerous enemies
of the Empire in the second half of the third century;
but their continuous history does not begin till
the second half of the fourth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gothic
kingdom

Danube.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We then find them
forming a great kingdom in the lands north of the
Danube.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Goths driven
onwards
by
the Huns.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Presently a large body of them were driven
to seek shelter within the bounds of the Eastern Empire
from the pressure of the invading <i>Huns</i>. These last
were a Turanian people who had been driven from
their own older settlements by movements in the
further East which do not concern us, but who become
an important element in the history of the fifth century.
They affected the Empire, partly by actual invasions,
partly by driving other nations before them
but they made no lasting settlements within it. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
did the Goths themselves make any lasting settlement
in the Eastern Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>They cross
the Danube.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;377.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
While one part of the Gothic
nation became subject to the Huns, another part
crossed the Danube; but they crossed it by Imperial
licence, and if they took to arms, it was only to
punish the treachery of the Roman officers. Presently
we find Gothic chiefs marching at pleasure through the
dominions of the Eastern Cæsar; but they simply march
and ravage; it is not till they have got within the
boundary of the West that they found any lasting kingdoms.
In fact, the Goths, and the Teutonic tribes
generally, had no real mission in the East; to them the
East was a mere highway to the West.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Career of
Alaric.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;394-410.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The movements
of Alaric in Greece, Illyricum, and Italy, his sieges and
his capture of Rome, are of the highest historical importance,
but they do not touch geography. The Goths
first win for themselves a local habitation and a place
on the map when they left Italy to establish themselves
in the further West.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning

<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;412.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Under Alaric’s successor, Athaulf, the first foundations
were laid of that great West-Gothic kingdom
which we are apt to look on as specially Spanish, but
which in truth had its first beginning in Gaul, and
which kept some Gaulish territory as long as it lasted.
But the Goths passed into those lands, not in the character
of avowed conquerors, not as founders of an
avowed Gothic state, but as soldiers of the Empire,
sent to win back its lost provinces.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Condition
of Gaul and
Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Those provinces
were now occupied or torn in pieces by a crowd of
invaders, <i>Suevi</i>, <i>Vandals</i>, and <i>Alans</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Alans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These last are
a puzzling race, our accounts of whom are somewhat
contradictory, but who may perhaps be most safely set
down as a non-Aryan, or, at any rate, a non-Teutonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
people, who had been largely brought under Gothic
influences. But early in the fifth century they possessed
a dominion in central Spain which stretched
from sea to sea.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Suevi
in Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Their dominion passed for a few
years into the hands of the Suevi, who had already
formed a settlement in north-western Spain, and who
still kept a dominion in that corner long after the
greater part of the peninsula had become Gothic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Vandals
in
Africa.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;425.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Vandals occupied Bætica; but they presently passed into
Africa, and there founded the one Teutonic kingdom
in that continent, with Carthage to its capital, a kingdom
which took in also the great islands of the western
Mediterranean, including Sicily itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Independence
of the
Basques.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Through all these
changes the unconquerable people of the Basque and
Cantabrian mountains seem never to have fully submitted
to any conquerors; but the rest of Spain and
south-western Gaul was, before half of the fifth century
had passed, formed into the great West-Gothic
kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gothic
kingdom
of Toulouse.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
That kingdom stretched from the pillars of
Hêraklês to the Loire and the Rhone, and its capital
was placed, not on Spanish but on Gaulish ground, at
the Gaulish Tolosa or <i>Toulouse</i>. The Gothic dominion
in Gaul was doomed not to be lasting; the Gothic
dominion in Spain lasted down to the Saracen conquest,
and all the later Christian kingdoms of Spain may be
looked on as fragments or revivals of it. Spain however
never changed her name for that of her conquerors.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gothia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The only parts of the Gothic kingdom which ever bore
the Gothic name were those small parts both of Spain
and Gaul which kept the name of <i>Gothia</i> through later
causes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Andalusia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Vandals, on the other hand, though they
passed altogether out of Spain, have left their name to
this day in its southern part under the form of <i>Andalusia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
a name which, under the Saracen conquerors,
spread itself over the whole peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Franks.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The other great Teutonic nations or confederacies of
which we have to speak have had a far more lasting
effect on the nomenclature of Europe. We have now
to trace the steps by which the <i>Franks</i> gradually became
the ruling people both of Germany and of Gaul.
They have stamped their name on both countries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Uses of the
word
<i>Francia</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
dominions of the Franks got the name of <i>Francia</i>,
a name whose meaning has constantly varied according
to the extent of the Frankish dominion at different
times. In modern use it still cleaves to two parts of
their dominions, to that part of Germany which is still
called <i>Franken</i> or <i>Franconia</i>, and to that part of
Gaul which is still called <i>France</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Alemanni.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And their history
is closely mixed up with that of another nation or confederacy,
that of the <i>Alemanni</i>, who again have, in the
French tongue, given their name to the whole of Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;275.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Franks and Alemanni alike begin to be heard of
in the third century, and the Alemanni even attempted
an actual invasion of Italy; but the geographical importance
of both confederacies does not begin till the
fifth. All through the fourth century it is the chief
business of the Emperors who ruled in Gaul to defend
the frontier of the Rhine against their incursions, against
the Alemanni along the upper part of its course, and
against the Franks along its lower part.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thuringians.<br />
The Low-Dutch
tribes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the east of
the Franks and Alemanni lay the <i>Thuringians</i>; to the
north, along the coasts of the German Ocean, the Low-Dutch
tribes, <i>Saxons</i> and <i>Frisians</i>. In the course of
the fifth century their movements also began to affect
the geography of the Empire.</p>

<p>During the whole of that century the Franks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
pressing into Gaul. The Imperial city of Trier was
more than once taken, and the seat of the provincial
government was removed to Arles.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reign of
Chlodwig.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;481-511.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The union of
the two chief divisions of the Frankish confederacy,
and the overthrow of the Alemanni, made the Franks,
under their first Christian king, Chlodwig or Clovis,
the ruling people of northern Gaul and central Germany.
Their territory thus took in both lands which
had been part of the Empire, and lands which had
never been such.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
and divisions
of the
Frankish
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This is a special characteristic of
the Frankish settlement, and one which influences
the whole of their later history. There was, from the
very beginning, long before any such distinction was
consciously drawn, a <i>Teutonic</i> and a <i>Latin Francia</i>.
There were Frankish lands to the East which never had
been Roman. There were lands in northern Gaul which
remained practically Roman under the Frankish dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Roman
Germany
Teutonized
afresh.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And between them lay, on the left bank of
the Rhine, the Teutonic lands which had formed part
of the Roman province of Gaul, but which now became
Teutonic again. <i>Moguntiacum</i>, <i>Augusta Treverorum</i>,
and <i>Colonia Agrippina</i>, cities founded on Teutonic soil,
now again became German, ready to be in due time,
by the names of <i>Mainz</i>, <i>Trier</i>, and <i>Köln</i>, the metropolitan
and electoral cities of Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eastern
and Western
<i>Francia</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These lands,
with the original German lands, formed the <i>Eastern</i>
or <i>Teutonic Francia</i>, where the Franks, or their German
allies and subjects, formed the real population
of the country. In the <i>Western Francia</i>, between
the Loire and the Channel, though the Franks largely
settled and influenced the country in many ways, the
mass of the population remained Roman.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Armorica
or Britanny.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Over the
western peninsula of <i>Armorica</i> the dominion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
Franks was always precarious and, at most, external.
Here the ante-Roman population still kept its Celtic
language, and it was further strengthened by colonies
from Britain, from which the land took its later name
of the <i>Lesser Britain</i> or <i>Britanny</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Frankish
dominion.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;500.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus, at the end
of the fifth century, the Frankish dominion was firmly
established over the whole of central Germany and
Northern Gaul. Their dominion was fated to be the
most lasting of the Teutonic kingdoms formed on the
Roman mainland. The reason is obvious; while the
Goths in Spain and the Vandals in Africa were isolated
Teutonic settlers in a Roman land, the Franks in Gaul
were strengthened by the unbroken Teutonic mainland
at their back.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Burgundians.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The greater part of Gaul was thus, at the end of the
fifth century, divided between the Franks in the north
and the West-Goths in the south. But, early in the
fifth century, a third Teutonic power grew up in south-eastern
Gaul.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>Burgundians</i>, a people who, in the
course of the Wandering of the Nations, seem to have
made their way from the shores of the Baltic, established
themselves in the lands between the Rhone and the
Alps, where they formed a kingdom which bore their
name. Their dominion in Gaul may be said to have
been more lasting than that of the Goths, less lasting
than that of the Franks.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Meaning of
the word
<i>Burgundy</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Burgundy</i> is still a recognized
name; but no name in geography has so often shifted its
place and meaning, and it has for some centuries settled
itself on a very small part of the ancient kingdom of
the Burgundians.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Provence
Burgundian.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;500-510.<br />
510-536.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of the fifth century the
Rhone was a Burgundian river; <i>Autun</i>, <i>Besançon</i>,
<i>Lyons</i>, and <i>Vienne</i> were Burgundian cities;
but the
sea coast, the original Roman <i>Province</i>, the land which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
has so steadily kept that name, though it fell for a
moment under the Burgundian power, followed at this
time, as became the first Roman land beyond the Alps,
the fortunes of Italy rather than those of Gaul.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Invasion
of the
Huns.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Among these various conquests and shiftings of dominion,
all of which affected the map at the time, some
of which have affected history and geography ever since,
it may be well to mention, if only by way of contrast,
an inroad which fills a great place in the history of the
fifth century, but which had no direct effect on geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of
Châlons.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;451.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This was the invasion of Italy and Gaul by
the <i>Huns</i> under Attila, and their defeat at Châlons
by the combined forces of Romans, West-Goths, and
Franks. This battle is one of the events which is remarkable,
not for working change, but for hindering
it. Had Attila succeeded, the greatest of all changes
would have taken place throughout all Western Europe.
As it was, the map of Gaul was not affected by his
inroad.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Destruction
of Aquileia,
and origin
of Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the map of Italy it did have an indirect
effect; he destroyed the city of Aquileia, and its inhabitants,
fleeing to the Venetian islands, laid the foundation
of one of the later powers of Europe in the
form of the commonwealth of <i>Venice</i>.</p>

<p>While Spain and Gaul were thus rent away from the
Empire, Italy and Rome itself were practically rent away
also, though the form which the event took was different.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reunion of
the Empire.<br />
Rule of
Odoacer.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;476-493.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A vote of the Senate reunited the Western Empire to the
Eastern; the Eastern Emperor Zeno became sole Emperor,
and the government of the diocese of Italy—that is, it will
be remembered, of a large territory besides the Italian
peninsula—was entrusted by his commission to Odoacer,
a general of barbarian mercenaries, with the rank
of Patrician. No doubt Odoacer was practically independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
of the Empire; but the union of the Empire
was preserved in form, and no separate kingdom of
Italy was set up.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The East-Goths
in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Presently Odoacer was overthrown
by Theodoric king of the East-Goths, who, though
king of his own people, reigned in Italy by an Imperial
commission as Patrician.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rule of
Theodoric.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;493-526.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Practically, he founded

lands which formed the dioceses of Italy and Western
Illyricum.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
his dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
His dominion also took in the coast of
what we may now call <i>Provence</i>, and his influence
was extended in various ways over most of the kingdoms
of the West. The seat of the Gothic dominion,
like that of the later Western Empire, was at Ravenna.
Practically Theodoric and his successors were independent
kings, and, as chiefs of their own people, they
bore the kingly title.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Theory of
the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Hence, as Rome formed part
of their dominions, it is true to say that under them
Rome ceased to be part of the Roman Empire. Still
in theory the Imperial supremacy went on, and in
this way it became much easier for Italy to be won
back to the Empire at a somewhat later time.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Settlement of the English in Britain.</i></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, in another part of Europe, a Teutonic
settlement of quite another character from those on
the mainland was going on.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Romans
withdrawn
from
Britain.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;411.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Spain and Gaul fell
away from the Empire by slow degrees; but the
Roman dominion in Britain came to an end by a definite
act at a definite moment. The Roman armies
were withdrawn from the province, and its inhabitants
were left to themselves. Presently, a new settlement
took place in the island which was thus left undefended.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difference
between the
conquest
of Britain
and other
Teutonic

It is specially important to mark the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
the Teutonic settlements in Britain and the Teutonic
conquests on the mainland. The Teutonic conquests in
Gaul and Spain were made by Teutonic neighbours
who had already learned to know and respect the Roman
civilization, who were either Christians already or became
Christians soon after they entered the Empire.
They pressed in gradually by land; they left the Roman
inhabitants to live after the Roman law, and they themselves
gradually adopted the speech and much of the
manners of Rome. The only exception to this rule on
the continent is to be found in the lands immediately
on the Rhine and the Danube, where the Teutonic
settlement was complete, and where the Roman tongue
and civilization were pretty well wiped out. This same
process happened yet more completely in the Teutonic
conquest of Britain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
of the
English
settlement;

struggle
with the
Britons.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great island possession of
Rome had been virtually abandoned by Rome before
the Teutonic settlements in it began. The invaders
had therefore to struggle rather with native Britons
than with Romans. Moreover, they were invaders who
came by sea, and who came from lands where little or
nothing was known of the Roman law or religion. They
therefore made a settlement of quite another kind from
the settlement of the Goths or even from that of the
Franks. They met with a degree of strictly national
resistance such as no other Teutonic conquerors met
with; therefore in the end they swept away all
traces of the earlier state of things in a way which took
place nowhere else.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The English
remain
Teutonic.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As far as such a process is possible,
they slew or drove out the older inhabitants;
they kept their heathen religion and Teutonic language,
and were thus able to grow up as a new Teutonic
nation in their new home without any important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
intermixture with the earlier inhabitants, Roman or
British.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Low-Dutch
settlements
in Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The conquerors who wrought this change were our
own forefathers, the Low-Dutch inhabitants of the
border lands of Germany and Denmark, quite away
from the Roman frontier; and among them three
tribes, the <i>Angles</i>, the <i>Saxons</i>, and the <i>Jutes</i>, had the
chief share in the conquest of Britain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saxons.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Saxons
had, as has already been said, attempted a settlement
in the fourth century. They were therefore the tribe
who were first known to the Roman and Celtic inhabitants
of the island; the Celts of Britain and Ireland
have therefore called all the Teutonic settlers <i>Saxons</i>
to this day.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
the name

But, as the Angles or <i>English</i> occupied
in the end much the greater part of the land, it was
they who, when the Teutonic tribes in Britain began to
form one nation, gave their name to that nation and
its land. That nation was the <i>English</i>, and their land
was <i>England</i>. While <i>Britain</i> therefore remains the
proper geographical name of the whole island, <i>England</i>
is the name of that part of Britain which was step
by step conquered by the English. Before the end
of the fifth century several Teutonic kingdoms had
begun in Britain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jutes in

<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;449.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Jutes began the conquest by
their settlement in <i>Kent</i>, and presently the <i>Saxons</i> began
to settle on the South coast and on a small part of the
East coast, in <i>Sussex</i>, <i>Wessex</i>, and <i>Essex</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saxon and

And along
a great part of the eastern coast various <i>Anglian</i> settlements
were made, which gradually grew into the kingdoms
of <i>East-Anglia</i>, <i>Deira</i>, and <i>Bernicia</i>, which two
last formed by their union the great kingdom of <i>Northumberland</i>.
But, at the end of the sixth century, the
English had not got very far from the southern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Welsh

The Britons, whom the English called
<i>Welsh</i> or strangers, held out in the West, and the
Picts and Scots in the North. The <i>Scots</i> were properly
the people of Ireland; but a colony of them had
settled on the western coast of northern Britain, and,
in the end, they gave the name of Scotland to the
whole North of the island.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>The Eastern Empire.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Contrast
between the
Eastern and
Western
Empires.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have already seen the differences between the
position of the Eastern and Western Empires during
this period. While in the West the provinces were
gradually lopped away by the Teutonic settlements,
the provinces of the East, though often traversed by
Teutonic armies, or rather nations, did not become
the seats of lasting Teutonic settlements.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Tetraxite
Goths.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We can
hardly count as an exception the settlement of the
<i>Tetraxite Goths</i> in the Tauric Chersonêsos, a land
which was rather in alliance with the Empire than
actually part of it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivalry
with Persia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The distinctive history of the
Eastern Empire consists, as has been already said, in
the long struggle between East and West, in which
Rome had succeeded to the mission of Alexander
and the Seleukids as the representative of Western
civilization. To this mission was afterwards added the
championship of Christianity, first against the Fire-worshipper
and then against the Moslem. In Eastern
history no event is more important and more remarkable
than the uprising of the regenerate <i>Persian</i> nation
against its Parthian masters.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Revival of
the Persian
kingdom.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;226.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, as far as either the
history or the geography of Rome is concerned, the
Persian simply steps into the place of the Parthian as
the representative of the East against the West. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
our point of view, the long wars on the Eastern frontier
of Rome, and the frequent shiftings of that frontier, form
one unbroken story, whether the enemy that was striven
against is the successor of Arsakes or the successor of
Artaxerxes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
Armenia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And besides the natural rivalry of two great
powers in such a position, the border kingdom of
<i>Armenia</i>, a name which has changed its meaning and its
frontiers almost as often as Burgundy or Austria, supplied
constant ground for dispute between Rome and
her eastern rival, whether Parthian or Persian.</p>

<p>In the geographical aspect of this long struggle
three special periods need to be pointed out.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Trajan.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;114-117.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first
is that of the momentary conquests of Trajan. Under
him <i>Armenia</i>, hitherto a vassal kingdom of Rome, was
incorporated as a Roman province. <i>Albania</i> and <i>Iberia</i>
took its place as the frontier vassal states. Beyond the
Euphrates, even beyond the Tigris, the Roman dominion
took in <i>Mesopotamia</i>, <i>Atropatênê</i>, and <i>Babylonia</i>. The
Parthian capital of Ktesiphôn and the outlying Greek
free city of Seleukeia were included within the boundaries
of an Empire which for a moment touched the
Caspian and the Persian Gulf. Rome, as the champion
of the West, seemed to have triumphed for ever over
her Eastern rival, when the Parthian kingdom was
thus shorn of the border lands of the two worlds, and
when its king was forced to become a Roman vassal for
the dominions that were left to him. But this vast
extension of the Roman power was strictly only for a
moment.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Trajan
surrendered
by Hadrian.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;117.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
What Trajan had conquered Hadrian at
once gave back; the Empire was again bounded by
the Euphrates, and Armenia was again left to form
matter of dispute between its Eastern and its Western
claimant.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Marcus.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;162-166.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The second stage begins when, under Marcus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
the Roman frontier again began to advance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Of Severus.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;197-202.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Between
the Euphrates and the Tigris <i>Osrhoênê</i> became a Roman
dependency: under the house of Severus it became a
Roman province; and the fortress of <i>Nisibis</i>, so famous
in later wars, was planted as the Eastern outpost of
Rome against the Parthian. Ten years later the Parthian
power was no more; but, as seen with Western eyes, the
revived monarchy of Persia had simply stepped into its
place. The wars of Alexander Severus, the captivity of
Valerian, the wasting march of Sapor through the Roman
provinces, left no trace on the map.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
under Diocletian.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;297.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But under the
mighty rule of Diocletian the glories of Trajan were
renewed. Mesopotamia again became Roman; five
provinces beyond the Tigris were added to the Empire;
Armenia, again the vassal of Rome, was enlarged at
the expense of Persia, and Iberia was once more a
Roman dependency. In the third stage the Roman
frontier again went back. The wars of the second
Sapor did little but deprive Rome of two Mesopotamian
fortresses.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Surrender
of provinces
by Jovian.
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>&nbsp;363.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But after the fall of Julian the
lands beyond the Tigris were given back to Persia;
even Nisibis was yielded, and the Persian frontier again
reached the Euphrates.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division
of Armenia.
387.<br />
The Hundred
Years’
Peace.
421.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Armenia was now tossed to
and fro, conquered and reconquered, till the kingdom
was divided between the vassals of the two Empires,
a division which was again confirmed by the hundred
years’ peace between Rome and Persia. This was the
state of the Eastern frontier of Rome at the time when
the West-Goths were laying the foundation of their
dominion in Spain and Aquitaine, when Goth and
Roman joined together to overthrow the mingled host
of Attila at Châlons, and when the first English keels
were on their way to the shores of Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span></p>

<p>This then is the picture of the civilized world at
the end of the fifth century. The whole of the Western
dominions of Rome, including Italy and Rome
herself, have practically, if not everywhere formally,
fallen away from the Roman Empire. The whole
West is under the rule of Teutonic kings. The
Frank has become supreme in northern Gaul, without
losing his ancient hold on western and central Germany.
The West-Goth reigns in Spain and Aquitaine;
the Burgundian reigns in the lands between the Rhone
and the Alps. Italy and the lands to the north of the
Alps and the Hadriatic have become, in substance
though not in name, an East-Gothic kingdom. But
the countries of the European mainland, though cut off
from Roman political dominion, are far from being cut
off from Roman influences. The Teutonic settlers, if
conquerors, are also disciples. Their rulers are everywhere
Christian; in Northern Gaul they are even
Orthodox. Africa, under the Arian Vandal, is far
more utterly cut off from the traditions of Rome than
the lands ruled either by the Catholic Frank or by the
Arian Goth. To the north of the Franks lie the
independent tribes of Germany, still untouched by any
Roman influence. They are beginning to find themselves
new homes in Britain, and, as the natural
consequence of a purely barbarian and heathen
conquest, to sever from the Empire all that they
conquered yet more thoroughly than Africa itself was
severed. Such is the state of the West. In the East
the Roman power lives on in the New Rome, with a
dominion constantly threatened and insulted by various
enemies, but with a frontier which has varied but little
since the time of Aurelian. No lasting Teutonic settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
has been made within its borders. In its endless
wars with Persia, its frontier sometimes advances and
sometimes retreats. In our next chapter we shall see
how much of life still clung to the majesty of the
Roman name, and how large a part of the ancient
dominion of Rome could still be won back again.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FINAL DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>The Reunion of the Empire.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Continuity
of Roman
rule.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> main point to be always borne in mind in the
history, and therefore in the historical geography, of
the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries, is the continued
existence of the Roman Empire. It was still the Roman
Empire, although the seat of its dominion was no longer
at the Old Rome, although for a while the Old Rome was
actually separated from the Roman dominion. Gaul,
Spain, Africa, Italy itself, had been lopped away. Britain
had fallen away by another process. But the Roman
rule went on undisturbed in the Eastern part of the
Empire, and even in the West the memory of that rule
had by no means wholly died out.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
the Teutonic
kings.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Teutonic kings
ruled in all the countries of the West; but nowhere on
the continent had they become national sovereigns.
They were still simply the chiefs of their own people
reigning in the midst of a Roman population. The
Romans meanwhile everywhere looked to the Cæsar of
the New Rome as their lawful sovereign, from whose
rule they had been unwillingly torn away. Both in Spain
and in Italy the Gothic kings had settled in the country
as Imperial lieutenants with an Imperial commission.
The formal aspect of the event of 476 had been the reunion
of the Western Empire with the Eastern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovery
of territory
by the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
perfectly natural therefore that the sole Roman Emperor
reigning in the New Rome should strive, whenever he
had a chance, to win back territories which he had
never formally surrendered, and that the Roman inhabitants
of those territories should welcome him as a
deliverer from barbarian masters. The geographical
limits within which, at the beginning of the sixth century,
the Roman power was practically confined, the
phænomena of race and language within those limits,
might have suggested another course. But considerations
of that kind are seldom felt at the time; they
are the reflexions of thoughtful men long after.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Roman
dominion
at the accession
of
Justinian,
527.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Roman dominion, at the accession of Justinian, was
shut up within the Greek and Oriental provinces of the
Empire; its enemies were already beginning to speak
of its subjects as Greeks. Its truest policy would have
been to have anticipated several centuries of history, to
have taken up the position of a Greek state, defending
its borders against the Persian, withstanding or inviting
the settlement of the Slave, but leaving the now
Teutonic West to develope itself undisturbed. But
in such cases the known past is always more powerful
than the unknown future, and it seemed the first duty
of the Roman Emperor to restore the Roman Empire
to its ancient extent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Justinian.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was during the reign of Justinian that this
work was carried out through a large part of the
Western Empire. Lost provinces were won back in
two continents. The growth of independent Teutonic
powers was for ever stopped in Africa, and it received
no small check in Europe. The Emperor was enabled,
through the weakness and internal dissensions of the
Vandal and Gothic kingdoms, to win back Africa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
Italy to the Empire. The work was done by the
swords of Belisarius and Narses—the Slave and the
Persian being now used to win back the Old Rome to
the dominion of the New.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Vandal
war.
533-535.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Mauritania, to the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gothic war.
537-554.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The long <i>Gothic</i> war won
back Illyricum, Italy, and the Old Rome. Italy and
Africa were still ruled from Ravenna and from Carthage;
but they were now ruled not by Teutonic kings,
but by Byzantine exarchs.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of

Spain.

Meanwhile, while the war
with the East-Goths was going on in Italy, a large part
of southern Spain was won back from the West-Goths.
Two Teutonic kingdoms were thus wiped out;
a third was weakened, and the acquisition of so great
a line of sea-coast, together with the great islands,
Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the Balearic Islands, gave
the Empire an undisputed supremacy by sea. In one
corner only did the Imperial frontier even nominally
go back, or any Teutonic power advance at its
expense.

Terminus withdrew.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geographical
changes
under
Justinian.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In a geographical aspect the map of Europe has
seldom been so completely changed within a single
generation as it was during the reign of Justinian. At
his accession his dominion was bounded to the west by
the Hadriatic, and he was far from possessing the whole
of the Hadriatic coast. Under his reign the power of the
Roman arms and the Roman law were again extended
to the Ocean. The Roman dominion was indeed no
longer spread round the whole shore of the Mediterranean;
the Imperial territories were no longer continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
as of old: but, if the Empire was not still, as it had
once been, the only power in the Mediterranean lands,
it had again become beyond all comparison the greatest
power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
Justinian’s
conquests.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Moreover, by the recovery of so large an extent
of Latin-speaking territory, the tendency of the Empire
to change into a Greek or Oriental state was checked
for several centuries. We are here concerned only
with the geographical, not with the political or moral
aspect of the conquests of Justinian. Some of those
conquests, like those of Trajan, were hardly more than
momentary. But the changes which they made for the
time were some of the most remarkable on record, and
the effect of those changes remained, both in history
and geography, long after their immediate results were
again undone.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Settlement of the Lombards in Italy.</i></h3>

<p>The conquests of Justinian hindered the growth of
a national Teutonic kingdom in Italy, such as grew up
in Gaul and Spain, and they practically made the cradle
of the Empire, Rome herself, an outlying dependency
of her great colony by the Bosporos. But the reunion
of all Italy with the Empire lasted only for a moment.
The conquest was only just over when a new set of
Teutonic conquerors appeared in Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pannonian
kingdom of
the Lombards.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were
the <i>Lombards</i>, who, in the great wandering, had made
their way into the ancient Pannonia about the time
that the East Goths passed into Italy. They were thus
settled within the ancient boundaries of the Western
Empire. But the Roman power had now quite passed
away from those regions, and the Lombard kingdom in
Pannonia was practically altogether beyond the Imperial
borders; it had not even that Roman tinge which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
affected the Frankish and Gothic kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gepidæ.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the
east of the Lombards, in the ancient Dacia, another
Teutonic kingdom had arisen; that of the <i>Gepidæ</i>, a
people seemingly closely akin to the Goths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Avars.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The process
of wandering had brought the Turanian <i>Avars</i> into
those parts, and their presence seriously affected all later
history and geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Teutonic
powers
on the
Lower
Danube.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
With the Gepidæ in Dacia
and the Lombards in Pannonia, there was a chance of
two Teutonic states growing up on the borders of East
and West. These might possibly have played the same
part in the East which the Franks and Goths played in
the West, and they might thus have altogether changed
the later course of history. But the Lombards allied
themselves with the Avars.

567.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In partnership with their
barbarian allies, they overthrew the kingdom of the
Gepidæ, and they themselves passed into Italy. Thus
the growth of Teutonic powers in those regions was
stopped. A new and far more dangerous enemy was
brought into the neighbourhood of the Empire, and
the way was opened for the Slavonic races to play
in some degree the same part in the East which the
Teutons played in the West. But while the East lost
this chance of renovation, for such it would have been,
the Lombard settlement in Italy was the beginning of a
new Teutonic power in that country.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
of the
Lombard
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it was not a
power which could possibly grow up into a national
Teutonic kingdom of all Italy, as the dominion of the
East-Goths might well have done.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Incomplete
conquest of
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Lombard conquest
of Italy was at no time a complete conquest; part
of the land was won by the Lombards; part was kept
by the Emperors; and the Imperial and Lombard possessions
intersected one another in a way which hindered
the growth of any kind of national unity under either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lombard
duchies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The new settlers founded the great Lombard
kingdom in the North of Italy, which has kept the
Lombard name to this day, and the smaller Lombard
states of <i>Spoleto</i> and <i>Beneventum</i>. But a large part of
Italy still remained to the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Imperial
possessions
in Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Ravenna, the
dwelling-place of the Exarchs, Rome itself, Naples, and
the island city of Venice were all centres of districts
which still acknowledged the Imperial rule. The Emperors
also kept the extreme southern points of both
the peninsulas of Southern Italy, and, for the present,
the three great islands. The Lombard Kings were constantly
threatening Rome and Ravenna.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ravenna

the Lombards.
c. 753.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Rome never
fell into their hands, but in the middle of the eighth
century Ravenna was taken, and with it the district
specially known as the <i>Exarchate</i> was annexed to the
Lombard dominion. But this greatest extent of the
Lombard power caused its overthrow: for it led to a
chain of events which, as we shall presently see, ended
in transferring not only the Lombard kingdom, but the
Imperial crown of the West to the hands of the Franks.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Rise of the Saracens.</i></h3>

<p>But, before we give any account of the revolutions
which took place among the already existing powers of
Western Europe, it will be well to describe the geographical
changes which were caused by the appearance of
absolutely new actors on two sides of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Roman
province
in Spain recovered
by
the Goths.
534-572.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
One
point however may be noticed here, as standing apart
from the general course of events, namely, that the
Roman province in Spain was won gradually back by
the West-Goths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>616-624.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The inland cities, as Cordova, were
hardly kept forty years, and the whole of the Imperial
possessions in Spain were lost during the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
Heraclius. Thus the great dominion which Justinian
had won back in the West, important as were its historical
results, was itself of very short duration; a large
part of Italy was lost almost as soon as it was won, and
the recovered dominion in Spain did not abide more
than ninety years.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, in the course of the seventh century,
nations which had hitherto been unknown or
unimportant began to play a great part in history and
greatly to change the face of the map. These new
powers fall under two heads; those who appeared on
the northern and those who appeared on the eastern
frontier of the Empire. The nations who appeared
on the North were, like the early Teutonic invaders
of the Empire, ready to act, if partly as conquerors,
partly also as disciples; those who appeared on
the East were the champions of an utterly different
system in religion and everything else. In short, the
old rivalry of the East and West now takes a distinctly
aggressive form on the part of the East.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wars between
Rome and
Persia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As long as
the Sassanid dynasty lasted, Rome and Persia still continued
their old rivalry on nearly equal terms. The
long wars between the two Empires made little difference
in their boundaries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wars of
Chosroes
and Heraclius,
603-628.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the last stage of their
warfare Chosroes took Jerusalem and Antioch, and
encamped at Chalkêdôn. Heraclius pressed his eastern
victories beyond the boundaries of the Empire under
Trajan. But even these great campaigns made no
lasting difference in the map, except so far as, by
weakening Rome and Persia alike, they paved the way
for the greatest change of all.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extension
of the
Roman
power on
the Euxine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
More important to
geography was a change which took place at somewhat
earlier time when, during the reign of Justinian, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
Roman power was extended on the Eastern side of the
Euxine in <i>Colchis</i> or <i>Lazica</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Arabian
vassals
of Rome
and Persia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The southern borders of
each Empire were to some extent protected by the
dominion of dependent Arabian kings, the <i>Ghassanides</i>
being vassals of Rome, and the <i>Lachmites</i> to the east of
them being vassals of Persia. But a change came
presently which altogether overthrew the Persian
kingdom, which deprived the Roman Empire of its
Eastern, Egyptian, and African provinces, and which
gave both the Empire and the Teutonic kingdoms of
the West an enemy of a kind altogether different from
any against whom they hitherto had to strive.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rise of the
Saracens.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The cause which wrought such abiding changes was
the rise of the <i>Saracens</i> under Mahomet and his first
followers. A new nation, that of the Arabs, now
became dominant in a large part of the lands which
had been part of the Roman Empire, as well as in
lands far beyond its boundaries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arabia
united
under
Mahomet,
622-632.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The scattered tribes
of Arabia were first gathered together into a single
power by Mahomet himself, and under his successors
they undertook to spread the Mahometan religion
wherever their swords could carry it. And, with the
Mahometan religion, they carried also the Arabic
language, and what we may call Eastern civilization as
opposed to Western. A strife, in short, now begins
between Aryan and Semitic man. Rome and Persia,
with all their differences, were both of them Aryan
powers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of the
Saracens.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The most amazing thing is the extraordinary
speed with which the Saracens pressed their conquests
at the expense of both Rome and Persia, forming a
marked contrast to the slow advance both of Roman conquest
and of Teutonic settlement. In the course of less
than eighty years, the Mahometan conquerors formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
a dominion greater than that of Rome, and, for a short
time, the will of the Caliph of the Prophet was obeyed
from the Ocean to lands beyond the Indus.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
the Eastern
provinces
of Rome.
632-639.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In a few
campaigns the Empire lost all its possessions beyond
Mount Tauros; that is, it lost one of the three great
divisions of the Empire, that namely in which neither
Greek nor Roman civilization had ever thoroughly
taken root.</p>

<p>While the Roman Empire was thus dismembered,
the rival power of Persia was not merely dismembered,
but utterly overwhelmed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saracen
conquest of
Persia.
632-651.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Persian nationality was
again, as in the days of the Parthians, held down under
a foreign power, to revive yet again ages later. But the
Saracen power was very far from merely taking the
place of its Parthian and Persian predecessors. The
mission of the followers of Mahomet was a mission of
universal conquest, and that mission they so far carried
out as altogether to overthrow the exclusive dominion
of Rome in her own Mediterranean. Under Justinian,
if the Imperial possession of the Mediterranean coast
was not absolutely continuous, the small exceptions in
Africa, Spain, and Gaul in no way interfered with the
maritime supremacy of the Empire, and Gaul and
Spain, even where they were not Roman, were at least
Christian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saracen
conquest of
Africa.
647-711.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But now a gradual advance of sixty-four
years annexed the Roman dominions in Africa to
the Mahometan dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Of Spain.
711-714.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thence the Saracens passed
into Spain, and found the West-Gothic kingdom an
easier prey than the Roman provinces. Within three
years after the final conquest of Africa, the whole
peninsula was conquered, save where the Christian still
held out in the inaccessible mountain fastnesses.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saracen

The
Saracen power was even carried beyond the Pyrenees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
into the province of Septimania, the remnant of the
Gaulish dominion of the West-Gothic kings. Narbonne,
Arles, Nîmes, all became for a while Saracen cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
Saracen
conquest.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In this way, of the three continents round the
Mediterranean, Rome lost all her possessions in Africa,
while both in Europe and Asia she had now a neighbour
and an enemy of quite another kind from any
which she had had before. The Teutonic conquerors,
if conquerors, had been also disciples; they became
part of the Latin world. The Persian, though his
rivalry was religious as well as political, was still
merely a rival, fighting along a single line of frontier.
But every province that was conquered by the Saracens
was utterly lopped away; it became the possession of
men altogether alien and hostile in race, language,
manners, and religion. A large part of the Roman
world passed from Aryan and Christian to Semitic and
Mahometan dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Different

But the essential differences
among the three main parts of the Empire now showed
themselves very clearly. The Eastern provinces, where
either Roman or Greek life was always an exotic, fell
away at the first touch.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>647-709.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Africa, as being so greatly
Romanized, held out for sixty years. The provinces
of Asia Minor, now thoroughly Greek, were often
ravaged, but never conquered. Spain and Septimania
were far more easily conquered than Africa—a sign
perhaps that the West-Gothic rule was still felt as
foreign by the Roman inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greatest

<p>With the conquest of Spain the undivided Saracenic
Empire, the dominion of the single Caliph, reached its
greatest extent in the three continents. Detached conquests
in Europe were made long after, but on the
whole the Saracen power went back.

Five years later Spain became the seat of a rival dynasty,

Franks.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Settlements of the Slavonic Nations.</i></h3>

<p>The movements of the sixth century began to bring
into notice a branch of the Aryan family of nations
which was to play an important part in the affairs both
of the East and of the West.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements
of the
Slaves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These nations were the
<i>Slaves</i>. It is needless for our purpose to attempt to
trace their earlier history; but the movements of the
<i>Avars</i> in the sixth century seem to have had much the
same effect upon the Slaves which the movements of the
Huns in the fourth century had upon the Teutons. The
inroads of the Avars had, as we have seen, checked the
growth of Teutonic powers on the Lower Danube, and
had led to the Lombard settlement in Italy. But the
Avars only formed the vanguard of a number of Turanian
nations, some at least of them Turkish, which were
now pressing westward.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
the Avars.<br />
Magyars,
&amp;c.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Avars formed a great kingdom
in the lands north of the Danube; to the east of
these, along the northern coasts of the Euxine, bordering
on the outlying possessions and allies of the Empire
in those regions, lay <i>Magyars</i>, <i>Patzinaks</i>, and the
greater dominion of the <i>Chazars</i>. All these play a part
in Byzantine history; and the Avars were in the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
century the most dangerous invaders and ravagers of
the Roman territory. But south of the Danube they
appeared mainly as ravagers; geography knows them
only in their settled kingdom to the north of that river.
Even that kingdom lasted no very great time; the real
importance of all these migrations consists in the effect
which they had on the great Aryan race which now
begins to take its part in history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>North-western
and South-western
Slaves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Slaves seem to
have been driven by the Turanian incursions in two
directions; to the North-west and to the South-west.
The North-western division gave rise to more than one
European state, and their relations with Germany form
an important part of the history of the Western Empire.
These North-western Slaves do not become of importance
till a little later. But the South-western division
plays a great part in the history of the sixth and seventh
centuries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Analogy
between
Teutons
and Slaves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Their position with regard to the Eastern
Empire is a kind of shadow of the position held by the
Teutonic nations with regard to the Western Empire.
The Slaves play in the East, though less thoroughly
and less brilliantly, the same part, half conquerors,
half disciples, which the Teutons played in the West.
During the sixth century they appear only as ravagers;
in the seventh they appear as settlers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slavonic
settlements
under
Heraclius.
c. 620.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There seems no
doubt that Heraclius encouraged Slavonic settlements
south of the Danube, doubtless with a view to defence
against the more dangerous Avars. Much like the Teutonic
settlers in the West, the Slaves came in at first as
colonists under Imperial authority, and presently became
practically independent. A number of Slavonic states
thus arose in the lands north and east of the Hadriatic,
as <i>Servia</i>, <i>Chrobatia</i> or <i>Croatia</i>, <i>Carinthia</i>, of which the
first two are historically connected with the Eastern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
and the third with the Western Empire. <i>Istria</i> and
<i>Dalmatia</i> now became Slavonic, with the exception of
the maritime cities, which, among many vicissitudes,
clave to the Empire. And even among them considerable
revolutions took place.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Destruction
of
Salona,
639.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus <i>Salona</i> was destroyed,
and out of Diocletian’s palace in its neighbourhood
arose the new city of <i>Spalato</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
Spalato
and Ragusa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Dalmatian
<i>Epidauros</i> was also destroyed, and <i>Ragusa</i> took its
place. In many of these inroads Slaves and Avars were
mixed up together; but the lasting settlements were
all Slavonic. And the state of things which thus began
has been lasting; the north-eastern coast of the Hadriatic
is still a Slavonic land with an Italian fringe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Displacement
of the
Illyrians.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In these migrations the Slaves displaced whatever
remnants were left of the old Illyrian race in the lands
near the Danube. They have themselves to some extent
taken the Illyrian name, a change which has sometimes
led to confusion. But at the time the movement went
much further south than this.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
Slavonic
settlement.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Slaves pressed on into
a large part of Macedonia and Greece, and, during the
seventh and eighth centuries, the whole of those countries,
except the fortified cities and a fringe along the
coast, were practically cut off from the Empire. The name
of <i>Slavinia</i> reached from the Danube to Peloponnêsos,
leaving to the Empire only islands and detached points
of coast from Venice round to Thessalonica. Their
settlements in these regions gave a new meaning to an
ancient name, and the word <i>Macedonian</i> now began to
mean <i>Slavonic</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Albanians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And it must have been at this time
that the Illyrians, the <i>Skipetar</i> or <i>Albanians</i>, pressed
southward and formed those colonies in Greece, some of
which still keep the Albanian language, while the Slavonic
language has vanished from those lands for ages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nature of
Slavonic
settlement
in Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Slavonic occupation of Greece is a fact which must
neither be forgotten nor exaggerated. It certainly did
not amount to an extirpation of the Greek nation; but
it certainly did amount to an occupation of a large part
of the country, which was Hellenized afresh from those
cities and districts which remained Greek or Roman.
While these changes were going on in the Hadriatic
and Ægæan lands, another immigration later in the
seventh century took place in the lands south of the
lower Danube, and drove back the Imperial frontier
to Haimos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlement
of the Bulgarians,
c. 679.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This was the incursion of the <i>Bulgarians</i>,
another Turanian people, but one whose history has
been different from that of most of the Turanian immigrants.
By mixture with Slavonic subjects and neighbours
they became practically Slavonic, and they still
remain a people speaking a Slavonic language.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern
Empire
cut short in
its own
peninsula.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus
the Empire, though it still kept its possessions in
Italy with the great Mediterranean islands, though its
hold on Western Africa lasted on into the eighth
century, though it still kept outlying possessions on
the northern and eastern coasts of the Euxine, was
cut short in that great peninsula which seems made
to be the immediate possession of the New Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Moral influence
of
Constantinople.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But, exactly as happened in the West, the loss of
political dominion carried with it the growth of moral
dominion. The nations which pressed into these provinces
gradually accepted Christianity in its Eastern
form, and they have always looked up to the New Rome
with a feeling the same in kind, but less strong in degree,
as that with which the West has looked up to the
Old Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Eastern
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, at the beginning of the eighth century,
though the Imperial power still held posts here and
there from the pillars of Hêraklês to the Kimmerian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
Bosporos, Saracens on the one side and Slaves on the
other had cut short the continuous Roman dominion to
a comparatively narrow space. The unbroken possessions
of Cæsar were now confined to Thrace and that
solid peninsula of Asia Minor which the Saracens constantly
ravaged, but never conquered. Mountains had
taken place of rivers as the great boundaries of the Empire:
instead of the Danube and the Euphrates, the
Roman Terminus had fallen back to Haimos and Tauros.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>The Transfer of the Western Empire to the Franks.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
the Franks.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile we must go back to the West, and trace
the growth of the great power which was there growing
up, a power which, while the elder Empire was thus
cut short in the East, was in the end to supplant it
in the West by the creation of a rival Empire. For
a while the <i>Franks</i> and the Empire had only occasional
dealings with each other. Next to Britain, which
had altogether ceased to be part of the Roman world,
the part of the Western Empire which was least affected
by the re-awakening of the Roman power in the East
was the former province of Transalpine Gaul. The
power of the Franks was fast spreading, both in their old
home in Germany and in their new home in Gaul.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Frankish
conquest of
the Alemanni,
496;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
victory of Chlodwig over the <i>Alemanni</i> made the Franks
the leading people of Germany. The two German
powers which had so long been the chief enemies of
the Roman power along the Rhine were now united.
Throughout the sixth century the German dominion of
the Franks was growing.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of the Thuringians,
c.
530;<br />
of Bavaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Frankish supremacy was
extended over <i>Thuringia</i>, and later in the century over
<i>Bavaria</i>. The Bavaria of this age, it must be remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
has a much wider extent than the name has in
modern geography, reaching to the northern borders of
Italy. The Bavarians seem to have been themselves
but recent settlers in the land between the Alps and the
Danube; but their immigration and their reduction
under Frankish supremacy made the lands immediately
south of the Danube thoroughly Teutonic, as the earlier
Frankish conquests had done by the lands immediately
west of the Rhine. Long before this time, the Franks
had greatly extended their dominions in Gaul also.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Aquitaine
[507-511]
and
Burgundy.
532-534.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the later years of Chlodwig the greater part of
<i>Aquitaine</i> was won from the West-Goths. Further
conquests at their expense were afterwards made, and
about the same time Burgundy came under Frankish
supremacy.</p>

<p>The Franks now held, either in possession or dependence,
the whole oceanic coast of Gaul; but they
were still shut out from the Mediterranean. The West-Goths
still kept the land from the Pyrenees to the Rhone,
the land of <i>Septimania</i> or <i>Gothia</i>, to which the last name
clave as being now the only Gothic part of Gaul. The
land which was specially <i>Provincia</i>, the first Roman possession
in Transalpine Gaul, the coast from the Rhone to
the Alps, formed part of the East-Gothic dominions of
Theodoric. An invasion of Italy during the long wars
between the Goths and Romans failed to establish a
Frankish dominion on the Italian side of the Alps.
But as the Franks, by their conquest of Burgundy, were
now neighbours of Italy, it led to a further enlargement
of their Gaulish dominions, and to their first acquisition
of a Mediterranean sea-board.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cession of
Provence.
536.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was now that Massalia,
Arelate, and the rest of the Province were, by an
Imperial grant, one of the last exercises of Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
power in those regions, added to the kingdom of the
Franks.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Frankish
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By the time that the Roman reconquest of
Italy was completed, the Frankish dominion, united for
a moment under a single head, took in the whole of
Gaul, except the small remaining West-Gothic territory,
together with central Germany and a supremacy over
the Southern German lands. To the north lay the still
independent tribes of the Low-Dutch stock, Frisian and
Saxon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
the Franks.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>As the Frankish dominion plays so great a part in
European history and geography, a part in truth second
only to that played by the Roman dominion, it will
be needful to consider the historical position of the
Franks. Their dominion was that of a German people
who had made themselves dominant alike in Germany
and in Gaul. But it was only in a small part of
the Frankish territory that the Frankish people had
actually settled.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The cession
of Gaulish
possessions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was only in northern Gaul and
central Germany, in the countries to which they have
permanently given their name, that the Franks can be
looked on as really occupying the land. In their
German territory they of course remained German; in
northern Gaul their position answered to that of the
other Teutonic nations which had formed settlements
within the Empire. They were a dominant Teutonic
race in a Roman land. Gradually they adopted the
speech of the conquered, while the conquered in
the end adopted the name of the conquerors.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slow fusion
of Franks
and Romans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
the fusion of German and Roman was slower in the
Frankish part of Gaul than elsewhere, doubtless because
elsewhere the Teutonic settlements were cut off
from their older Teutonic homes, while the Franks
in Gaul had their older Teutonic home as a background.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German
and Gaulish
dependencies
of the
Franks.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Beyond the bounds of these more strictly
Frankish lands, German and Gaulish, the dominion of
the Franks was at most a political supremacy, and in
no sense a national settlement. In Germany Bavaria
was ruled by its vassal princes; in Gaul south of the
Loire the Frank was at most an external ruler.
Aquitaine had to be practically conquered over and
over again, and new dynasties of native princes were
constantly rising up.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ethnology
of Southern
Gaul.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Teutonic element in these
lands, an element much slighter than the Teutonic
element in Northern Gaul, is not Frankish, but Gothic
and Burgundian. The native Romance speech of
those lands is wholly different from the Romance
speech of Northern Gaul. In short, there was really
nothing in common between the two great parts of
Gaul, the lands south and the lands north of the Loire,
except their union, first under Roman and then under
Frankish dominion. And in Armorica the old Celtic
population, strengthened by the settlers from Britain,
formed another and a yet more distinct element.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Divisions of
the Frankish
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus there were within the Frankish dominions
wide national diversities, containing the germs of future
divisions. It needed a strong hand even to keep the
Teutonic and the Latin <i>Francia</i> together, much less to
keep together all the dependent lands, German and
Gaulish. During the ages while the Empire was being
cut short by Lombards, Goths, Slaves, and Saracens,
the Frankish dominion was never in the like sort cut
short by foreign settlements; but its whole history
under the Merowingian dynasty is a history of divisions
and reunions. The tendencies to division which were
inherent in the condition of the country were strengthened
by endless partitions among the members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
reigning house.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><i>Austria</i>
and
<i>Neustria</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Speaking roughly, it may be said
that the more strictly Frankish territory showed a
tendency to divide itself into two parts, the Eastern or
Teutonic land, <i>Austria</i> or <i>Austrasia</i>, and <i>Neustria</i>, the
Western or Romance land. These were severally the
germs which grew into the kingdoms of Germany and
France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
name
<i>Francia</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As for the mere name of <i>Francia</i>, like other
names of the kind, it shifted its geographical use
according to the wanderings of the people from whom
it was derived. After many such changes of meaning,
it gradually settled down as the name for those parts of
Germany and Gaul where it still abides. There are the
Teutonic or Austrian <i>Francia</i>, part of which still keeps
the name of <i>Franken</i> or <i>Franconia</i>, and the Romance
or Neustrian <i>Francia</i>, which by various annexations
has grown into modern <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>At last, after endless divisions, reconquests, and reunions
of the different parts of the Frankish territory, the
whole Frankish dominion was again, in the second half
of the eighth century, joined together under the Austrasian,
the purely German, house of the <i>Karlings</i>. The
Dukes and Kings of that house consolidated and extended
the Frankish dominion in every direction. Under
Pippin and Charles the Great, the power of the ruling
race was more firmly established over the dependent
states, such as Bavaria and Aquitaine.

Under Pippin
the conquest of the Saracen province of Septimania
extended the Frankish power over the whole of Gaul;
and under Charles the Great, the Frankish dominion
was extended by a series of conquests in every direction.
Of these, his Italian conquests were rather
the winning of a new crown for the Frankish king
than the extension of the Frankish kingdom. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
conquest of <i>Saxony</i> at the one end and of the <i>Spanish
March</i> at the other, as well as the overthrow of the
Pannonian kingdom of the Avars, were in the strictest
sense extensions of the Frankish dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German
character of
the Frankish
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Frankish power which now plays so great a part in the
world was a power essentially German. The Franks
and their kings, the kings who reigned from the Elbe
to the Ebro, were German in blood, speech, and
feeling; but they bore rule over other lands, German,
Latin, and Celtic, in many various degrees of incorporation
and subjection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The three
great powers
of the
eighth century;
Romans,
Franks,
Saracens.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus the effect of the Saracen conquests was to leave
in Europe one purely European power, namely the
kingdom of the Franks, one power both European and
Asiatic, namely the Roman Empire with its seat at
Constantinople, and one power at once Asiatic, African,
and European, namely the Saracen Caliphate. Through
the eighth century these three are the great powers of
the world, to which the other nations of Europe and
Asia form, as far as we are concerned, a mere background.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
of the

But the Caliphate, as a Semitic and Mahometan
power, could be European only in a geographical sense.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Saracen
dominion
in Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Even after the establishment of the independent Saracen
dominion in Spain, the new power still remained an
exotic. A great country of Western Europe was no
longer ruled from Damascus or Bagdad; but the emirate,
afterwards Caliphate, of Cordova, and the kingdoms
into which it afterwards broke up, still remained
only geographically European. They were portions of
Asia—in after times rather of Africa—thrusting themselves
into Europe, like the Spanish dominion of Carthage
in earlier times. The two great Christian powers,
the two great really European powers, are the Roman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
the Frankish. We now come to the process which for
a while caused the Roman and Frankish names to have
the same meaning within a large part of Europe, and
by which the two seats of Roman dominion were again
parted asunder, never to be reunited.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations of

<p>The way by which the Roman and Frankish
powers came to affect one another was through the
affairs of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Imperial
possessions
in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The steps by which the Imperial power
was, during the eighth century, weakened step by step
in the territories which still remained to the Empire in
central Italy are, either from an ecclesiastical or from
a strictly historical point of view, of surpassing interest.
But, as long as the authority of the Emperor was not
openly thrown off, no change was made on the map.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lombard
conquest

Overthrow
of the
Lombards
by Charles.
774.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The events of those times which did make a change on
the map were, first the conquest of the Exarchate by
the Lombards, and secondly, the overthrow of the
Lombard kingdom itself by the Frank king Charles
the Great. The Frankish power was thus at last
established on the Italian side of the Alps, but it must
be remarked that the new conquest was not incorporated
with the Frankish dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lombardy
a separate
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Charles held
his Italian dominion as a separate dominion, and called
himself King of the Franks and Lombards. He also
bore the title of Patrician of the Romans; but,
though the assumption of that title was of great
political significance, it did not affect geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Title of
Patrician.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
title of Patrician of itself implied a commission from
the Emperor, and, though it was bestowed by the
Bishop and people of Rome without the Imperial
consent, the very choice of the title showed that
the Imperial authority was not formally thrown off.
Charles, as Patrician, was virtually sovereign of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
and his acquisition of the patriciate practically extended
his dominion from the Ocean to the frontiers of
Beneventum.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nominal
authority
of the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, down to his Imperial coronation
in the last week of the eighth century, the Emperor
who reigned in the New Rome was still the nominal
sovereign of the old. The event of the year 800,
with all its weighty significance, did not practically
either extend the territories of Charles or increase
his powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of
the Imperial
coronation
of
Charles.
800.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Still the Imperial coronation of Charles is one of
the great landmarks both of history and of historical
geography. The whole political system of Europe was
changed when the Old Rome cast off its formal allegiance
to the New, and chose the King of the Franks
and Lombards to be Emperor of the Romans. Though
the powers of Charles were not increased nor his dominions
extended, he held everything by a new title.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Final division
of the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Roman Empire was divided, never to be joined together
again. But its Western half now took in, not only
the greatest of its lost provinces, but vast regions which
had never formed part of the Empire in the days of
Trajan himself. Again, the distinctive character of the
older Roman Empire had been the absence of nationality.
The whole civilized world had become Rome,
and all its free inhabitants had become Romans.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growing
nationality
of the two
Empires,
German
and Greek.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
from this time each of the two divisions of the Empire
begins to assume something like a national character.
East and West alike remained Roman in name and in
political traditions. The Old Rome was the nominal
centre of one; the New Rome was both the nominal
and the real centre of the other. But there was a
sense in which both alike ceased from this time to be
Roman. The Western Empire has passed to a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
king, and later changes tended to make his Empire
more and more German. The Eastern Empire meanwhile,
by the successive loss of the Eastern provinces, of
Latin Africa, and of Latin Italy, became nearly conterminous
with those parts of Europe and Asia where
the Greek speech and Greek civilization prevailed.
From one point of view, both Empires are still Roman;
from another point of view, one is fast becoming
German, the other is fast becoming Greek.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivalry of
the two
Empires.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And the
two powers into which the old Roman Empire is thus
split are in the strictest sense two Empires. They are
no longer mere divisions of an Empire which has been
found to be too great for the rule of one man. The
Emperors of the East and West are no longer Imperial
colleagues dividing the administration of a single Empire
between them. They are now rival potentates, each
claiming to be exclusively the one true Roman Emperor,
the one true representative of the common predecessors
of both in the days when the Empire was still undivided.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The two
Caliphates.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It is further to be noted that the same kind of
change which now happened to the Christian Empire,
had happened earlier in the century to the Mahometan
Empire. The establishment of a rival dynasty
at Cordova, even though the assumption of the actual
title of Caliph did not follow at once, was exactly
analogous to the establishment of a rival Empire
in the Old Rome. The Mediterranean world has now
four great powers, the two rival Christian Empires,
and the two rival Mahometan Caliphates. Among
these, it naturally follows that each is hostile to its
neighbour of the opposite religion, and friendly to
its neighbour’s rival. The Western Emperor is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
enemy of the Western Caliph, the friend of the Eastern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivalry
of the Empires
and
Caliphates.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Eastern Emperor is the enemy of the Eastern
Caliph, the friend of the Western. Thus the four
great powers stood at the beginning of the ninth
century. And it was out of the dismemberments of
the two great Christian and the great Mahometan
powers that the later states, Christian and Mahometan,
of the Mediterranean world took their rise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Carolingian
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It is a point of geographical as well as of historical
importance that Charles the Great, after he was crowned
Emperor, caused all those who had been hitherto bound
by allegiance to him as King of the Franks to swear
allegiance to him afresh as Roman Emperor. This marks
that all his dominions, Frankish, Lombard, and strictly
Roman, are to be looked on as forming part of the
Western Empire. Thus the Western Empire now took in
all those German lands which the old Roman Emperors
never could conquer. Germany became part of the
Roman Empire, not by Rome conquering Germany, but
by Rome choosing the German king as her Emperor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Contrast of
its boundaries
with
those of the
elder Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The boundaries of the Empire thus became different
from what they had ever been before. Of the old
provinces of the Western Empire, Britain, Africa, and
all Spain save one corner, remained foreign to the new
Roman Empire of the Franks. But, on the other hand,
the Empire now took in all the lands in Germany and
beyond Germany over which the Frankish power now
reached, but which had never formed part of the elder
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
Saxony.
772-804.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The long wars of Charles with the Saxons led to
their final conquest, to the incorporation of <i>Saxony</i> with
the Frankish kingdom, and, after the Imperial coronation
of the Frankish king, to its incorporation with the
Western Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span></p>

<p>The conquests of Charles had thus, among their
other results, welded Germany into a single whole. For
though the Franks had long been the greatest power in
Germany, yet Germany could not be said to form a
single whole as long as the Saxons, the greatest people
of Northern Germany, remained independent. The
conquest of Saxony brought the Frankish power for
the first time in contact with the <i>Danes</i> and the other
people of <i>Scandinavia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Boundary
of the
Eider.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dominions of Charles took
in what was then called Saxony beyond the Elbe, that
is the modern Holstein, and the <i>Eider</i> was fixed as the
northern boundary of the Empire. More than one
Danish king did homage to Charles and to some of
the Emperors after him; but Denmark was never incorporated
with the Empire or even made permanently
dependent.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slavonic
allies and
neighbours.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the east, the immediate dominions of
Charles stretched but a little way beyond the Elbe; but
here the Western Empire came in contact, as the Eastern
had done at an earlier time and by a different process,
with the widely spread nations of the Slavonic race.
The same movements which had driven one branch of
that race to the south-west had driven another branch
to the north-west, and the wars of Charles in those
regions gave his Empire a fringe of Slavonic allies and
dependents along both sides of the Elbe, forming a
barrier between the immediate dominions of the Empire
and the independent Slaves to the east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Overthrow
of the Avar
kingdom.
796.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the
south Charles overthrew the kingdom of the <i>Avars</i>; he
thus extended his dominions on the side of south-eastern
Germany, and here he came in contact with the southern
branch of the Slaves, a portion of whom, in <i>Carinthia</i>
and the neighbouring lands, became subjects of his
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Spanish
March.
778.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Spain he acquired the north-eastern corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
as far as the Ebro, forming the Spanish March, afterwards
the county of Barcelona.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Divisions
of the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus the new Western Empire took in all Gaul, all
that was then Germany, the greater part of Italy, and
a small part of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It thus took in both Teutonic
and Romance lands, and contained in it the germs of
the chief nations of modern Europe. It was a step
towards their formation when Charles, following the
example both of earlier Roman Emperors and of earlier
Frankish kings, planned several divisions of his dominions
among his sons. Owing to the deaths of all his
sons but one, none of these divisions took effect. And
it should be noticed that as yet none of these schemes of
division agreed with any great natural or national
boundary. They did not as yet foreshadow the division
which afterwards took place, and out of which
the chief states of Western Europe grew. In two
cases only was anything like a national kingdom
thought of.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Aquitaine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Charles’s son Lewis reigned under him
as king in <i>Aquitaine</i>, a kingdom which took in all
Southern Gaul and the Spanish March, answering
pretty nearly to the lands of the Provençal tongue or
tongue of <i>Oc</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Death of
Charles.
814.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And when Charles died, and was succeeded

of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom

The <i>Kingdom of Italy</i> must be understood

Frankish kingdoms, Gaulish and German. The words
<i>Gallia</i> and <i>Germania</i> are used in a strictly geographical
sense.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>Northern Europe.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Scandinavians
and
English.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile other nations were beginning to show
themselves in those parts of Europe which lay beyond
the Empire. In north-western Europe two branches
of the Teutonic race were fast growing into importance;
the one in lands which had never formed part of the
Empire, the other in a land which had been part of it,
but which had been so utterly severed from it as to be
all one as if it had never belonged to it. These were
the <i>Scandinavian</i> nations in the two great peninsulas of
Northern Europe, and the <i>English</i> in the Isle of Britain.
The history of these two races is closely connected, and
it has an important bearing on the history of Europe in
general.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Stages of
the English
conquest of
Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In Britain itself the progress of the English arms
had been gradual. Sometimes conquests from the
Britons were made with great speed: sometimes the
English advance was checked by successes on the British
side, by mere inaction, or by wars between the
different English kingdoms. The fluctuations of victory,
and consequently of boundaries, between the English
kingdoms were quite as marked as the warfare between
the English and the Britons.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
English
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among the many Teutonic
settlements in Britain, small and great, seven kingdoms
stand out as of special importance, and three
of these, <i>Wessex</i>, <i>Mercia</i>, and <i>Northumberland</i>, again
stand out as candidates for a general supremacy over
the whole English name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Britain at
the end of
the eighth
century.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of the eighth
century a large part of Britain remained, as it still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
remains, in the hands of the elder Celtic inhabitants;
but the parts which they still kept were now cut off
from each other.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Celtic
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Cornwall</i> or <i>West-Wales</i>, <i>North-Wales</i>
(answering nearly to the modern principality), and <i>Strathclyde</i>
or <i>Cumberland</i> (a much larger district than the
modern county so called) were all the seats of separate,
though fluctuating, British states. Beyond the Forth
lay the independent kingdoms of the <i>Picts</i> and <i>Scots</i>,
which, in the course of the ninth century, became one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>West-Saxon
supremacy
under
Ecgberht.
802-837.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was the West-Saxon kingdom to which the supremacy
over all the kingdoms of Britain, Teutonic
and Celtic, came in the end. Ecgberht, its king, had
been a friend and guest of Charles the Great, and he
had most likely been stirred up by his example to do in
his own island what Charles had done on the mainland.
In the course of his reign, West-Wales was completely
conquered; the other English kingdoms, together with
North-Wales, were brought into a greater or less degree
of dependence. But both in North-Wales and also in
Mercia, Northumberland, and East-Anglia, the local
kings went on reigning under the supremacy of the King
of the West-Saxons, who now began sometimes to call
himself <i>King of the English</i>. In the north both Scotland
and Strathclyde remained quite independent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Scandinavian
nations.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">That part also of the Teutonic race which lay altogether
beyond the bounds of the Empire now begins
to be of importance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Danes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>Danes</i> are heard of as
early as the days of Justinian; but neither they nor
the other Scandinavian nations play any great part
in history before the time of Charles the Great. A
great number of small states gradually settled down
into three great kingdoms, which remain still, though
their boundaries have greatly changed. The boundary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
between Denmark and the Empire was, as we
have seen, fixed at the Eider.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
Denmark
and Norway.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides the peninsula
of Jutland and the islands which still belong to it,
Denmark took in <i>Scania</i> and other lands in the south
of the great peninsula that now forms <i>Sweden</i> and
<i>Norway</i>. Norway, on the other hand, ran much further
inland, and came down much further south than it does
now. These points are of importance, because they
show the causes of the later history of the three
Scandinavian states.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sweden.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Both Denmark and Norway had a
great front to the Ocean, while <i>Swithiod</i> and <i>Gauthiod</i>,
the districts which formed the beginning of the kingdom
of Sweden, had no opening that way, but were altogether
turned towards the Baltic. It thus came about that for
some centuries both Denmark and Norway played a
much greater part in the general affairs of Europe than
Sweden did.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Danish and

Denmark was an immediate neighbour
of the Empire, and from both Denmark and Norway

of Britain, Ireland and Gaul, besides colonizing the
more distant and uninhabited lands of <i>Iceland</i> and
<i>Greenland</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pressure of

Meanwhile, the Swedes pressed eastward

of the Eastern Empire; but in Western history Sweden
counts for very little till a much later time.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Summary.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During the period which has been dealt with in
this chapter, taking in the sixth, seventh, and eighth
centuries, we thus see, first of all the reunion of the
greater part of the Roman Empire under Justinian—then
the lopping away of the Eastern and African
provinces by the conquests of the Saracens—then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
gradual separation of all Italy except the south, ending
in the re-establishment of a separate Western Empire
under Charles the Great. We thus get two great Christian
powers, the Eastern and Western Empires, balanced
by two great Mahometan powers, the Eastern and
Western Caliphates. All the older Teutonic kingdoms
have either vanished or have grown into something
wholly different. The Vandal kingdom of Africa and
the East-Gothic kingdom have wholly vanished. The
West-Gothic kingdom, cut short by Franks on one
side and Saracens on the other, survives only in the
form of the small Christian principalities which still
held their ground in Northern Spain. The Frankish
kingdom, by swallowing up the Gothic and Burgundian
dominions in Gaul, the independent nations of
Germany, the Lombard kingdom, and the more part
of the possessions of the Empire in Italy, has grown
into a new Western Empire. The two Empires, both
still politically Roman, are fast becoming, one German
and the other Greek. Meanwhile, nations beyond
the bounds of the Empire are growing into importance.
The process has begun by which the many
small Teutonic settlements in Britain grew in the end
into the one kingdom of England. The three Scandinavian
nations, Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians or
Northmen, now begin to grow into importance. In
a religious point of view, if Syria, Egypt, Africa,
and the more part of Spain were lost to Christendom,
the loss was in some degree made up by the
conversion to Christianity of the Angles and Saxons
in Britain, of the Old-Saxons in Germany, and of the
other German tribes which at the beginning of the
sixth century had still been heathen. At no time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
the world’s history did the map undergo greater changes.
This period is the time of real transition from the
older state of things represented by the undivided
Roman Empire to the newer state of things in which
Europe is made up of a great number of independent
states. The modern kingdoms outside the Empire, in
Britain and Scandinavia, were already forming. The
great continental nations of Western Europe had as
yet hardly begun to form. They were to grow out
of the break-up of the Carolingian Empire, the Roman
Empire of the Franks.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

Northern Gaul and
central Germany were still alike <i>Francia</i>; and, though
the Romance speech prevailed in one, and the Teutonic
speech in the other, no national distinction was
drawn between them during the time of Charles the
Great. Among the proposed divisions of his Empire,
none proposed to separate <i>Neustria</i> and <i>Austria</i>, the
Western and the Eastern <i>Francia</i>.

But Italy did form

and so for a while there was an under-kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
of Aquitaine, answering roughly to Gaul south of the
Loire. This is the land of the <i>Provençal</i> tongue, the
<i>tongue of Oc</i>, a tongue which, it must be remembered,
reached to the Ebro.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division

First
glimpses
of Modern
France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is in the various divisions,
contemplated and actual, among the sons of Lewis the
Pious, the successor of Charles the Great, that we see
the first approaches to a national division between Germany
and Gaul, and the first glimmerings of a state
answering in any way to <i>France</i> in the modern sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division of
817.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The earliest among those endless divisions that we
need mention is the division of 817, by which two new
subordinate kingdoms were founded within the Empire.
Lewis and his immediate colleague Lothar kept
in their own hands <i>Francia</i>, German and Gaulish, and
the more part of Burgundy. South-western Gaul,
Aquitaine in the wide sense, with some small parts of
Septimania and Burgundy, formed the portion of one
under-king; South-eastern Germany, Bavaria and
the march-lands beyond it, formed the portion of
another. Italy still remained the portion of a third.
Here we have nothing in the least answering to
modern France. The tendency is rather to leave
the immediate Frankish kingdom, both in Gaul and
Germany, as an undivided whole, and to part off
its dependent lands, German, Gaulish, and Italian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of

and Aquitaine

But, in a much later division, Lewis granted Neustria
to his son Charles, and in the next year, on the
death of Pippin of Aquitaine, he added his kingdom
to that of Charles. A state was thus formed which
answers roughly to the later kingdom of France, as
it stood before the long series of French encroachments
on the German and Burgundian lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character

<i>Western

The
kingdom thus formed had no definite name, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
answered to no national division. It was indeed mainly
a kingdom of the Romance speech, but it did not
answer to any one of the great divisions of that
speech. It was a kingdom formed by accident, because
Lewis wished to increase the portion of his youngest
son. Still there can be no doubt that we have
here the first beginning of the kingdom of <i>France</i>,
though it was not till after several other stages
that the kingdom thus formed took that name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division of
Verdun.
843.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
final division of Verdun went a step further in the
direction of the modern map. It left Charles in possession
of a kingdom which still more nearly answered
to France, as France stood before its Burgundian and
German annexations. It also founded a kingdom
which roughly answered to the later <i>Germany</i> before
its great extension to the East at the expense of the
Slavonic nations. And, as the Western kingdom was
formed by the addition of Aquitaine to the Western
<i>Francia</i>, so the Eastern kingdom was formed by the
addition of the Eastern <i>Francia</i> to Bavaria. Lewis of
Bavaria became king of a kingdom which we are
tempted to call the kingdom of <i>Germany</i>. Still it
would as yet be premature to speak of France at
all, or even to speak of Germany, except in the geographical
sense.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdoms
of the Eastern
and
Western
Franks.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The two kingdoms are severally the
kingdoms of the <i>Eastern</i> and of the <i>Western Franks</i>.
But between these two states the policy of the ninth
century instinctively put a barrier. The Emperor
Lothar, besides Italy, kept a long narrow strip of territory
between the dominions of his Eastern and
Western brothers. After him, Italy remained to his
son the Emperor Lewis, while the border lands of Germany
and Gaul passed to the younger Lothar.

This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
land, having thus been the dominion of two Lothars,
took the name of <i>Lotharingia</i>, <i>Lothringen</i>, or <i>Lorraine</i>,
a name which part of it has kept to this day. This land,
sometimes attached to the Eastern kingdom, sometimes to
the Western, sometimes divided between the two, sometimes
separated from both, always kept its character of
a border-land.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The

The kingdom to the west of it, in like

to the same analogy, should be <i>Charlaine</i>. It is only
by a caprice of language that the name of Lotharingia
has survived, while that of Karolingia has died out.</p>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division on
his deposition.
887.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On his deposition they split asunder again. We
now have four distinct kingdoms, those of the <i>Eastern</i>
and <i>Western Franks</i>, the forerunners of Germany and
France, the kingdom of <i>Italy</i>, and <i>Burgundy</i>, sometimes
forming one kingdom and sometimes two. <i>Lotharingia</i>
remained a border-land between the Eastern and Western
kingdoms, attached sometimes to one, sometimes to
another. Out of these elements arose the great kingdoms
and nations of Western Europe. The four can
hardly be better described than they are by the Old-English
Chronicler: ‘Arnulf then dwelled in the land
to the East of Rhine; and Rudolf took to the middle
kingdom; and Oda to the West deal; and Berengar
and Guy to the Lombards’ land, and to the lands on
that side of the mountain.’ But the geography of all
the four kingdoms which now arose must be described
at somewhat greater length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span></p>

<p class="pb2">It must be borne in mind that all these divisions
of the great Frankish dominion were, in theory, like
the ancient divisions of the Empire, a mere parcelling
out of a common possession among several royal colleagues.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>No formal
titles or
names of
the Frankish
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Kings had no special titles, and their
dominions had no special names recognized in formal
use. Every king who ruled over any part of the
ancient <i>Francia</i> was a King of the Franks, just as
much as all among the many rulers of the Roman
Empire in the days of Diocletian and Constantine were
equally Roman Augusti or Cæsars. As the kings and
their kingdoms had no formal titles specially set apart
for them, the writers of the time had to describe them
as they might.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Various
names of

or <i>Germany</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Eastern part of the Frankish dominions,
the lot of Lewis the German and his successors,
is thus called the <i>Eastern Kingdom</i>, the <i>Teutonic Kingdom</i>.
Its king is the <i>King of the East-Franks</i>, sometimes
simply the King of the <i>Eastern men</i>, sometimes
the <i>King of Germany</i>. This last name, convenient in use,
was inaccurate as a formal title, for the <i>Regnum Teutonicum</i>
lay geographically partly in Germany, partly
in Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> To the men of the Western kingdom the
Eastern king sometimes appeared as the <i>King beyond the
Rhine</i>. The title of <i>King of Germany</i> is often found in
the ninth century as a description, but it was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
formal title. The Eastern king, like other kings, for the
most part simply calls himself <i>Rex</i>, till the time came
when his rank as King of Germany or of the East-Franks
became simply a step towards the higher title of
Emperor of the Romans.

Arnulf indeed, the first
German King after the division, made his way to Rome
and was crowned Emperor; and it marks the position
of the Eastern kingdom as the chief among the
kingdoms of the Franks, that the West-Frankish King
Odo did homage to Arnulf before his lord’s Imperial
coronation, when he was still simple German king.

The rule that whoever was chosen King of Germany
had a right, without further election, to the
kingdom of Italy and to the Roman Empire, began
only with the coronation of Otto the Great. Up to
that time, the German king is simply one of the kings
of the Franks, though it is plain that he held the
highest place among them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the German
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">This Eastern or German kingdom, as it came out
of the division of 887, had, from north to south, nearly
the same extent as the Germany of later times. It
stretched from the Alps to the Eider. Its southern
boundaries were somewhat fluctuating. <i>Verona</i> and
<i>Aquileia</i> are sometimes counted as a German march,
and the boundary between Germany and Burgundy,
crossing the modern Switzerland, often changed. To
the North-east the kingdom hardly stretched beyond
the Elbe, except in the small Saxon land between the
Elbe and the Eider. The great extension of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
German power over the Slavonic lands beyond the
Elbe had hardly yet begun.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Austrian
and Carinthian
marks.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the South-east lay
the two border-lands or <i>marks</i>; the <i>Eastern Mark</i>,
which grew into the later duchy of <i>Oesterreich</i> or the
modern <i>Austria</i>, and to the south of it the mark of
<i>Kärnthen</i> or <i>Carinthia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The great
duchies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the main part of the
kingdom consisted of the great duchies of <i>Saxony</i>,
<i>Eastern Francia</i>, <i>Alemannia</i>, and <i>Bavaria</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saxony.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of these
the two names of Saxony and Bavaria must be carefully
marked as having widely different meanings
from those which they bear on the modern map.
Ancient Saxony lies, speaking roughly, between the
Eider, the Elbe, and the Rhine, though it never actually
touches the last-named river.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eastern or
Teutonic
<i>Francia</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the south
of Saxony lies the Eastern <i>Francia</i>, the centre and
kernel of the German kingdom. The Main and the
Neckar both join the Rhine within its borders. To
the south of Francia lie <i>Alemannia</i> and <i>Bavaria</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Alemannia
and Bavaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last, it must be remembered, borders on Italy,
with Bötzen for its frontier town. Alemannia is
the land in which both the Rhine and the Danube
take their source; it stretches on both sides of
the <i>Bodensee</i> or Lake of Constanz, with the Rætian
Alps as its southern boundary. For several ages to
come, there is no distinction, national or even provincial,
between the lands north and south of the
Bodensee.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lotharingia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">These lands make up the undoubted Eastern or
German territory. To the west of this lies the border
land of <i>Lotharingia</i>, which has a history of its own.
For the first century after the division of 887, the possession
of Lotharingia fluctuated several times between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
the Eastern and the Western kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>987.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After the
change of dynasty in the Western kingdom, Lotharingia
became definitely and undoubtedly German in allegiance,
though it always kept up something of a distinct
being, and its language was partly German and partly
Romance. Lotharingia took in the two duchies of the
<i>Ripuarian Lotharingia</i> and <i>Lotharingia on the Mosel</i>.
The former contains a large part of the modern Belgium
and the neighbouring lands on the Rhine, including
the royal city of Aachen. Lotharingia on the Mosel
answers roughly to the later duchy of that name,
though its extent to the East is considerably larger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Western
Kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The part of the Frankish dominions to which the
Frankish name has stuck most lastingly has been the
Western kingdom or <i>Karolingia</i>, which gradually got
the special name of <i>France</i>. This came about through
the events of the ninth and tenth centuries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its extent.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Western kingdom, as it was formed under Charles the
Bald and as it remained after the division of 887,
nominally took in a great part of modern France,
namely all west of the Rhone and Saône. It took in
nothing to the east of those rivers, and Lotharingia, as
we have seen, was a border land which at last settled
down as part of the Eastern kingdom. Thus the
extent of the old <i>Karolingia</i> to the east was very
much smaller than the extent of modern France. But,
on the other hand, the Western kingdom took in
lands at three points which are not part of modern
France. These are the march or county of <i>Flanders</i>
in the north, the greater part of which forms part of
the modern kingdom of Belgium; the <i>Spanish March</i>, or
county of <i>Barcelona</i>, which is now part of Spain; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
the <i>Norman Islands</i> which are now held by the sovereign
of England. And it is hardly needful to say that,
even within these boundaries, the whole land was not in
the hands of the King of the West-Franks. He had only
a supremacy, which was apt to become nearly nominal,
over the vassal princes who held the great
divisions of the kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The great
fiefs.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
South of the Loire the
chief of these vassal states were the duchy of <i>Aquitaine</i>,
a name which now means the land between the Loire
and the Garonne—the duchy of <i>Gascony</i> between the
Garonne and the Pyrenees—the county of <i>Toulouse</i> to
the east of it—the marches of <i>Septimania</i> and <i>Barcelona</i>.
North of the Loire were <i>Britanny</i>, where native
Celtic princes still reigned under a very doubtful
supremacy on the part of the Frankish kings—the
march of <i>Flanders</i> in the north—and the duchy of
<i>Burgundy</i>, the duchy which had Dijon for its capital,
and which must be carefully distinguished from other
duchies and kingdoms of the same name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Duchy
of France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And,
greatest of all, there was the duchy of <i>France</i>, that is
<i>Western</i> or <i>Latin France</i>, <i>Francia Occidentalis</i> or
<i>Latina</i>. Its capital was Paris, and its princes were
called <i>Duces Francorum</i>, a title in which the word
<i>Francus</i> is just beginning to change from its older
meaning of <i>Frank</i> to its later meaning of <i>French</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Normandy

912.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From this great duchy of France several great fiefs, as
<i>Anjou</i> and <i>Champagne</i>, were gradually cut off, and the
part of France between the Seine and the Epte was
granted to the Scandinavian chief Rolf, which, under
him and his successors, grew into the great duchy of
<i>Normandy</i>. Its capital was Rouen, and this settlement
of the Normans had the effect of cutting off
France and its capital Paris from the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p class="pb2">The modern French kingdom gradually came into

During this time the crown of the
Western kingdom passed to and fro more than once
between the Dukes of the French at Paris and the
princes of the house of Charles the Great, whose only
immediate dominion was the city and district of <i>Laon</i>
near the Lotharingian border. Thus, for a hundred
years, the royal city of the Western kingdom was
sometimes Laon and sometimes Paris, and the King
of the West-Franks was sometimes the same person
as the Duke of the French and sometimes not.

But
after the election of Hugh Capet, the kingdom and
the duchy were never again separated. The Kings

persons.

king, no one would have spoken of them as parts
of France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance

But, as the French kings, step by
step, got possession of the dominions of their vassals
and other neighbours, the name of <i>France</i> gradually
spread, till it took in, as it now does, by far the
greater part of Gaul. On the other hand, Flanders,
Barcelona, and the Norman islands, though once
under the homage of the French kings, have fallen
altogether away, and have therefore never been
reckoned as parts of France. Thus the name of
<i>France</i> supplanted the name of <i>Karolingia</i> as the

that the Western kings kept on the title of

Burgundian name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French
Duchy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of the older Burgundian kingdom,
the north-western part, forming the land best
known as the <i>Duchy of Burgundy</i>, was, in the divisions
of the ninth century, a fief of Karolingia or the
Western kingdom. This is the Burgundy which has
Dijon for its capital, and which was held by more than
one dynasty of dukes as vassals of the Western kings,
first at Laon and then at Paris. This Burgundy, which,
as the name of France came to bear its modern sense, may
be distinguished as the <i>French Duchy</i>, must be carefully
distinguished from the <i>Royal</i> Burgundy, the <i>Middle
Kingdom</i> of our own chronicler.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Kingdom
of
Burgundy
or Arles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This is a state which
arose out of the divisions of the ninth century, and
which, sometimes as a single kingdom, sometimes as
two, took in all the rest of the old Burgundian kingdom
which did not form part of the French duchy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
It may be roughly defined as the land between the
Rhone and Saône and the Alps, though its somewhat
fluctuating boundaries sometimes stretched west of the
Rhone, and its eastern frontier towards Germany changed
more than once. It thus took in the original Roman
province in Gaul, which may be now spoken of as
<i>Provence</i>, with its great cities, foremost among them
<i>Arelate</i> or <i>Arles</i>, which was the capital of the kingdom,
and from which the land was sometimes called the <i>Kingdom
of Arles</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cities of the
Burgundian
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It also took in Lyons, the primatial city
of Gaul, Geneva, Besançon, and other important Roman
towns. In short, from its position, it contained a
greater number of the former seats of Roman power
than any of the new kingdoms except Italy itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cis-jurane.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
When Burgundy formed two kingdoms, the Northern
or <i>Trans-jurane</i> Burgundy took in, speaking roughly,
the lands north of Lyons,
and <i>Cis-jurane</i> Burgundy
those between Lyons and the sea. These last are now
wholly French. The ancient Transjurane Burgundy is
in modern geography divided between France and
Switzerland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Burgundy

<p class="pb2">The history of this Burgundian kingdom differs
in one respect from that of any other of the states
which arose out of the break-up of the Frankish Empire.
It parted off wholly from the Carolingian dominion
before the division of 887. It formed no part of the
reunited Empire of Charles the Fat. It may therefore
be looked on as having parted off altogether from the
immediately Frankish rule, though it often appears as
more or less dependent on the kings of the Eastern
Francia. But its time of separate being was short.

After
about a century and a half from its foundation, the
Burgundian kingdom was united under the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
kings as Germany, and its later history consists of
the way in which the greater part of the old Middle
Kingdom has been swallowed up bit by bit by the
modern kingdom of France. The only part which
has escaped is that which now forms the western
cantons of Switzerland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Partly

In truth the Swiss Confederation
may be looked on as having, in some slight
degree, inherited the position of the Burgundian kingdom
as a middle state. Otherwise, while the Eastern
and Western kingdoms of the Franks have grown into
two of the greatest powers and nations in modern
Europe, the Burgundian kingdom has been altogether
wiped out. Not only its independence, but its very
name, has passed from it. The name Burgundy has for
a long time past been commonly used to express the

<p class="pb2">Italy, unlike Burgundy, formed part of the reunited
dominion of Charles the Fat; but it altogether passed
away from Frankish rule at the division of 887. It
must be remembered that, though Lombardy was conquered
by Charles the Great, yet it was not merged
in the Frankish dominions, but was held as a separate
kingdom by the King of the Franks and Lombards.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Carolingian

Till the reunion under Charles the Fat, Italy, as a
separate kingdom, was ruled by kings of the Carolingian
house, some of whom were crowned at Rome as
Emperors. After the final division, it had separate
kings of its own, being not uncommonly disputed between
two rival kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Italian

Some of these kings even obtained
Imperial rank.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Italian
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Italian kingdom, it must
be remembered, was far from taking in the whole
Italian peninsula. Its southern boundary was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
the same as the old boundaries of Latium and Picenum,
reaching somewhat further to the south on the Hadriatic
coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Separate
principalities
of
Benevento
and Salerno.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the south were the separate principalities of
<i>Benevento</i> and <i>Salerno</i>, and the lands which still clave
to the Eastern Emperors. The kingdom thus took in
Lombardy, Liguria, <i>Friuli</i> in the widest sense, taking
in <i>Trent</i> and <i>Istria</i>, though these latter lands are sometimes
counted as a German march, while the Venetian
islands still kept up their connexion with the Eastern
Empire. It took in also <i>Tuscany</i>, <i>Romagna</i> or the
former Exarchate of Ravenna, <i>Spoleto</i>, and <i>Rome</i> itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Kingdom

The Italian kingdom thus represented the old Lombard
kingdom, together with the provinces which were
formally transferred from the Eastern to the Western
Empire by the election of Charles the Great. But it
may be looked on as essentially a continuation of the
Lombard kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Milan its

The rank of capital of the Italian
kingdom, as distinguished from the Roman Empire,
passed away from the old Lombard capital of <i>Pavia</i>
to the ecclesiastical metropolis of <i>Milan</i>, and Milan
became the crowning-place of the Kings of Italy.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Abeyance
of the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>For nearly eighty years after the division of 887,
the Roman Empire of the West may be looked on as
having fallen into a kind of abeyance. One German
and several Italian kings were crowned Emperors;
but they never obtained any general acknowledgement
throughout the West. There could not be said to be
any Western Empire with definite geographical boundaries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Restoration
of the
Western
Empire by
Otto.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A change in this respect took place in the
second half of the tenth century under the German
king Otto the Great.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>952.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
While he was still only German
king, Berengar King of Italy became his man, as Odo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
of Paris had become the man of Arnulf.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>962, 963.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Afterwards
Otto himself obtained the Italian kingdom, and was
crowned Emperor at Rome. The rule was now fully
established that the German king who was crowned
at Aachen had a right to be crowned King of Italy at
Milan and Emperor at Rome. A geographical Western
Empire was thus again founded, consisting of the two
kingdoms of Germany and Italy, to which Burgundy was
afterwards added.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The three
Imperial
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These three kingdoms now formed
the Empire, which thus consisted of the whole dominions
of Charles the Great—allowing for a different eastern
frontier—except the part which formed the Western
kingdom, <i>Karolingia</i>, afterwards <i>France</i>. This union of
three of the four kingdoms gave a more distinct and antagonistic
character to the fourth which remained separate.
Karolingia looked like a part of the great
Frankish dominion lopped off from the main body.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations
between the
Empire
and France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the other hand, now that the German kings, the
Kings of the East-Franks, were also Kings of Italy and
Burgundy and Emperors of the Romans, they gradually
dropped their Frankish style. But, as that
style was kept by the Western kings, and still more as
the name of their duchy of France gradually spread
over so large a part of Gaul, the kingdom of France
had a superficial look of representing the old Frankish
kingdom. The newly-constituted Empire had thus a
distinctly rival power on its western side. And we
shall find that a great part of our story will consist of
the way in which, on this side, the Imperial frontier
went back, and the French frontier advanced. On the
other side, the Eastern frontier of the Empire was
capable of any amount of advance at the cost of its
Slavonic neighbours.</p>

<h3>§ 2. <i>The Eastern Empire.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The effect of the various changes of the seventh
and eighth centuries, the rise of the Saracens, the
settlement of the Slaves, the transfer of the Western
Empire to the Franks, seem really to have had the
effect of strengthening the Eastern Empire which they
so terribly cut short. It began for the first time to
put on something of a national character.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>It takes a
Greek
character.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the
Western Empire was fast becoming German, so the
Eastern Empire was fast becoming Greek.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivalry of
the Eastern
and Western
or Greek
and Latin
Churches.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And a
religious distinction was soon added to the distinction
of language. As the schism between the Churches
came on, the Greek-speaking lands attached themselves
to the Eastern, and not to the Western, form of
Christianity. The Eastern Empire, keeping on all
its Roman titles and traditions, had thus become
nearly identical with what may be called the artificial
Greek nation. It continues the work of hellenization
which was begun by the old Greek colonies and which
went on under the Macedonian kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations
in the
extent of
the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
No power
gives more work for the geographer; through the
alternate periods of decay and revival which make up
nearly the whole of Byzantine history, provinces were
always being lost and always being won back again.
And it supplies also a geographical study of another
kind, in the new divisions into which the Empire was
now mapped out, divisions which, for the most part,
have very little reference to the divisions of earlier
times.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The <i>Themes</i>
as described
by
Constantine
Porphyrogennêtos.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The <i>Themes</i> or provinces of the Eastern Empire,
as they stood in the tenth century, have had the privilege
of being elaborately described by an Imperial geographer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
in the person of Constantine Porphyrogennêtos.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
He speaks of the division as comparatively recent, and
of some themes as having been formed almost in his
own time. The themes would certainly seem to have
been mapped out after the Empire had been cut short
both to the north and to the east. The nomenclature
of the new divisions is singular and diversified.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Asiatic
Themes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Some ancient national names are kept, while the titles
of others seem fantastic enough. Thus in Asia <i>Paphlagonia</i>
and <i>Kappadokia</i> remain names of themes with
some approach to their ancient boundaries; but the
<i>Armenian</i> theme is thrust far to the west of any of the
earlier uses of the name, so that the Halys flows through
it. Between it and the still independent Armenia lay the
theme of <i>Chaldia</i>, with Trapezous, the future seat of
Emperors, for its capital. Along the Saracen frontier lie
the themes of <i>Kolôneia</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i>—a shadowy survival
indeed of the Mesopotamia of Trajan, of which it
was not even a part—<i>Sebasteia</i>, <i>Lykandos</i>, <i>Kappadokia</i>,
and <i>Seleukeia</i>, called from the Isaurian or Kilikian city of
that name. Along the south coast the city of <i>Kibyra</i>
has given—in mockery, says Constantine—its name
to the theme of the <i>Kibyrraiotians</i>, which reaches as
far as Milêtos. The isle of <i>Samos</i> gives its name to
a theme reaching from Milêtos to Adramyttion, while
the theme of the <i>Ægæan Sea</i>, besides most of the
islands, stretches on to the mainland of the ancient
Aiolis. The rest of the Propontis is bordered by
themes bearing the strange names of <i>Opsikion</i> and
<i>Optimatôn</i>, names of Latin origin, in the former of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
which the word <i>obsequium</i> is to be traced. To the
east of them the no less strangely named <i>Thema
Boukellariôn</i> takes in the Euxine Hêrakleia. Inland
and away from the frontier are the themes <i>Thrakêsion</i>
and <i>Anatolikon</i>, while another Asiatic theme is formed
by the island of <i>Cyprus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The European
Themes.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The nomenclature of the European themes is more
intelligible. Most of them bear ancient names, and
the districts which bear them are at least survivals of
the lands which bore them of old. After a good deal
of shifting, owing to the loss and recovery of so many
districts, the Empire under Constantine Porphyrogennêtos
numbered twelve European themes. <i>Thrace</i> had
shrunk up into the land just round Constantinople and
Hadrianople, the latter now a frontier city against the
Bulgarian. <i>Macedonia</i> had been pushed to the east,
leaving the more strictly Macedonian coast-districts
which the Empire still kept to form the themes of
<i>Strymôn</i> and <i>Thessalonikê</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
name
Hellas.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Going further south, the
name of <i>Hellas</i> has revived, and that with a singular
accuracy of application. Hellas is now the eastern side
of continental Greece, taking in the land of Achilleus.
The abiding name of Achaia has vanished for a while,
and the peninsula which had been won back from the
Slave again bears its name of <i>Peloponnêsos</i>. But <i>Lakedaimonia</i>
now appears on the list of its chief cities
instead of Sparta. This and other instances in which
one Greek name has been supplanted by another are
witnesses of the Slavonic occupation of Hellas and its
recovery by a Greek-speaking power. Off the west
coast the realm of Odysseus seems to revive in the
theme of <i>Kephallênia</i>, which takes in also the mythic
isle of Alkinoos. Such parts of Epeiros and Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
Greece as clave to the Empire form the theme of
<i>Nikopolis</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Hadriatic
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the north, on the Hadriatic shore, was
the theme of <i>Dyrrhachion</i>, and beyond that again, the
Dalmatian and Venetian cities still counted as outlying
portions of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Possessions
of the Empire
in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Beyond the Hadriatic, southern
Italy forms the theme of <i>Lombardy</i>, interrupted by the
principality of <i>Salerno</i>, while Naples, Gaeta, and Amalfi
were outlying posts like Venice and Ragusa. <i>Sicily</i> was
still reckoned as a theme; but it was now wholly lost
to the Saracen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Chersôn.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And far away in the Tauric peninsula,
the last of the Hellenic commonwealths, the furthest
outpost of Hellenic civilization, had sunk in the ninth
century into the Byzantine theme of <i>Chersôn</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Seeming
Asiatic
character
of the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first impression conveyed by this geographical
description is that the Eastern Empire had now become
a power rather Asiatic than European. It is only in
Asia that any solid mass of territory is kept.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nature of

Elsewhere
there are only islands and fringes of coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Maritime

of the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
they were almost continuous fringes of coast, fringes
which contained some of the greatest cities of Christendom,
and which gave their masters an undisputed
supremacy by sea. If the Mediterranean was not a
Byzantine lake, it was only the presence of the
Saracen, the occasional visits of the Northman, which
hindered it from being so. Then again, the whole history
of the Empire, if a history of losses, is also a history
of recoveries, and before long the Roman arms again
became terrible by land. The picture of Constantine
Porphyrogennêtos shows us the Empire at a moment
when neither process was actually going on; but the
times before and after his reign were times, first of loss
and then of recovery.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss and

823-960.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Early in the ninth century <i>Crete</i>
was suddenly seized by Saracen adventurers from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
Spain; about the same time began the long and slow

But, almost at the moment
when Sicily was lost, the Imperial province in Italy
was largely increased, and the Imperial influence in
Dalmatia was largely restored. About the same time
Peloponnêsos was won back from the Slaves.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of

Presently
Basil the Second overthrew the <i>Bulgarian</i> kingdom in

the lands
at the foot of Caucasus admitted the Imperial supremacy,
and the Byzantine rule was carried round the
greater part of the Euxine.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of

Cherson indeed was lost;
the old Megarian city passed into the hands of the
Russian. At the other end of the Empire, the recovery
of Sicily was actually begun, and, if the Saracen
was not driven out, his power was weakened in the
interest of the next set of invaders.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern

Early in the
eleventh century the Eastern Rome was again the
head of a dominion which was undoubtedly the greatest
among Christian powers, a dominion greater than
it had been at any time since the Saracenic and Slavonic
inroads began.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Origin of the Spanish Kingdoms.</i></h3>

<p>The historical geography of two of the three great
Southern peninsulas is thus bound up with that of the
Empires of which they were severally the centres.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The case is quite different with the third great peninsula,
that of Spain. There the Roman dominion, even
the province which had been recovered by Justinian,
had quite passed away, and it was only a small part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
the land which was ever reincorporated, even in the
most shadowy way, with either Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Saracen
conquest.
710-713.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Spain was
now conquered by the Saracens, as it had before been
conquered by the Romans, with this difference, that it
had been among the longest and hardest of the Roman
conquests, while no part of the Saracen dominion was
won in a shorter time. But, if the Roman conquest was
slow, it was in the end complete. The swifter Saracen
conquest was never quite complete; it left a remnant
by which the land was in the end to be won back.
But the part of the land which withstood the Saracen
was, as could hardly fail to be the case, the same part
as that which held out for the longest time against
the Roman. The mountainous regions of the North
were never wholly conquered.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Asturia
732,<br />
united with
Cantabria,
751.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Cantabria</i> and <i>Asturia</i>,
which had never fully submitted to the Goths, now
became the seat of resistance under princes who
claimed to represent the Gothic kings, and part of
whose dominions bore the name of <i>Gothia</i>. Twenty
years after the conquest, Asturia was again a Christian
principality, which was presently united with Cantabria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Leon, 916.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This grew into the kingdom of <i>Leon</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Castile, 904.<br />
Kingdom,
1033.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
great fiefs of this kingdom on its eastern and western
borders,
the counties of <i>Gallicia</i> and <i>Castile</i>—the last
originally a line of <i>castles</i> against the Saracen enemy—both
showed from an early time strong tendencies
to separation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Navarre.
905.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile the kingdom of <i>Navarre</i>
grew up to the east, stretching, it must be remembered,
on both sides of the Pyrenees, though by
far the larger portion of it lay on their southern
side.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Aragon c.
760.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the east of Navarre the small counties of
<i>Aragon</i> and <i>Riparanensia</i> were the beginning of the
kingdom of <i>Aragon</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Spanish
March.
778.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the east again of this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
the land which, after the final expulsion of the Saracens
from Gaul, became part of the Carolingian Empire
by the name of the <i>Spanish March</i>. The shiftings of
territory, the unions and separations of these various
kingdoms and principalities, belong to the special
history of Spain. But early in the eleventh century
the whole north-western part of Spain, and a considerable
fringe of territory in the north-east, had
been formed into Christian states.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginnings
of Castile
and
Aragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among these had
been laid the foundations of two kingdoms, those of
Castile and Aragon, which were to play a great part in
the affairs of Europe.</p>

<p class="pb2">It will be at once seen that those among the Spanish
powers which were destined to play the greatest part in
later history were not among the first to take the form
of separate kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slow
growth of
the greater
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At this stage even Castile has
hardly taken the form of a distinct state. Aragon is
only beginning; <i>Portugal</i> has not even begun.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>History of
Castile and
Aragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of
these three, Castile was fated to play the same part that
was played by Wessex in England and by France in
Gaul, to become the leading power of the peninsula.
Aragon, when her growth had brought her to the
Mediterranean, was to fill for a long time a greater
place in general European politics than any other Spanish
power. The union of Castile and Aragon was to form
that great Spanish monarchy which became the terror
of Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Portugal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile Portugal, lying on the Ocean,
had first of all to extend her borders at the cost of the
common enemy, and afterwards to become a beginner
of European enterprise in distant lands, a path in which
Castile and other powers did but follow in her steps.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Break-up of
the Spanish
Caliphate.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile the advance of the Christians was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
helped by the division of the Saracenic power. The
Caliphates of the East and of the West fell to pieces,
exactly as the Christian Empires did. The undivided
Mahometan dominion in Spain was at the height of its
power in the tenth century. Yet even then, amid
many fluctuations, the Christian frontier was on the
whole advancing in the north-west. In the north-east
Christian progress was slower.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1028.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, early in the
eleventh century, the Caliphate of Cordova broke in
pieces, and out of its fragments arose a crowd of small
Mahometan kingdoms at Cordova, Seville, Lisbon,
Zaragoza, Toledo, Valencia, and elsewhere. It was
now only by renewed invasions from Africa that the
Mahometan power in Spain was kept up. But, as the
Christian states are now fully formed, such mention of
these African dynasties as concerns geography will
come more fittingly at a later stage.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Origin of the Slavonic States.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slavonic
and Turanian
invasions.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We left the borders of both the Eastern and the
Western Empire beset by neighbours of Slavonic race,
who, in the case of the Eastern Empire, were largely
mingled with other neighbours of Turanian race. Of
these last, <i>Avars</i>, <i>Patzinaks</i>, <i>Khazars</i>, have passed
away; they have left no trace on the modern map of
Europe. With two of the Turanian settlements the
case is different.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bulgarians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The settlement of the <i>Bulgarians</i>,
the foundation of a kingdom of Slavonized Turanians
south of the Danube, has been already mentioned.
They still keep their place and nation, though in bondage.
Another Turanian settlement to the north of the
Bulgarians has been of yet greater importance in
European history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlement of the Magyars
or
Hungarians,
895.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the last years of the ninth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
century the Finnish <i>Magyars</i> or <i>Hungarians</i>, the
<i>Turks</i> of the Byzantine writers, began to count as a
power in Europe. From their seats between the
mouths of the Dnieper and the Danube, they pressed
eastward into the lands which had been Dacia and
Pannonia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Great
Moravia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Bulgarian power was thus confined to
the lands south of the Danube, and <i>Great Moravia</i>, a
name which then took in the western part of modern
Hungary, fell wholly under Magyar dominion.</p>

<p>This settlement is one which stands altogether by
itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Peculiar
character of
the Magyar
settlement.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Magyars and the Ottoman Turks are the
only Turanian settlers in Europe who have grown into
permanent Turanian powers on European ground. The
Bulgarians have been lost in the mass of their Slavonic
neighbours and subjects, whose language they have
adopted. Magyars and Ottomans still remain speaking
a Turanian tongue on Aryan soil. But of these it is
only the Magyars that have grown into a really European
state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Kingdom
of
Hungary.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After appearing as momentary ravagers
in Germany, Italy, and even Gaul, the Magyars settled
down into a Christian kingdom, which, among many
fluctuations of supremacy and dependence, has remained
a distinct kingdom to this day.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of its
religious
connexion
with Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Christianity
of Hungary however came from the Western
Church and not from the Eastern. And this fact has
had a good deal of bearing upon the history of those
regions. But for this almost incidental connexion with
the Old Rome, Hungary, though settled by a Turanian
people, would most naturally have taken its place
among the Slavonic states which fringed the dominion
of the New Rome. As it has turned out, difference of

<p>The geographical results of the Magyar settlement
were to place a barrier between the Northern and the
Southern Slaves. This it did both directly and indirectly.
The <i>Patzinaks</i> pressed into what had been the
former Magyar territory; they appear in the pages of
the Imperial geographer as a nation with whom the
Empire always strove to maintain peace, as they formed
a barrier against both Hungarians and <i>Russians</i>.

This

race, they were cut off from the other members of that
branch south of the Danube by these new Turanian
settlements. The Magyars again parted the South-eastern
Slaves from the North-western, while the
Russians were still neighbours of the North-western
Slaves.

The South-eastern Slaves in
Servia, Croatia, Dalmatia, and the neighbouring lands,
formed a debateable ground between the two Empires,
the Magyar kingdom, and the Venetian republic, as
soon as Venice grew into a distinct and conquering
state. These lands have, down to our own time,
played an important, but commonly a secondary, part
in history. And in later times their history has chiefly
consisted in successive changes of masters. The states
which they formed will have to be spoken of in connexion
with the greater and more lasting powers to
which they have commonly been adjuncts.

Russia had then already assumed the
character which it has again put on in later times,
that of the one great European power at once Slavonic
in race and Eastern in faith. Russia is now fully
established as an European power. The variations of
its territorial extent must be traced in a distinct

<h3>§ 5. <i>Northern Europe.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Scandinavian
settlements.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The European importance of the Scandinavian nations
at this time chiefly arises from their settlements in
various parts of Europe, and specially in Britain and
Ireland. The three great Scandinavian kingdoms were
already formed. Sweden was doing its work towards
the east; the Norwegians, specially known as Northmen,
colonized the extreme north of Britain, the Scandinavian
earldoms of Caithness and Sutherland, together
with the islands to the north and west of
Britain, Orkney, Shetland, Faroe, the so-called Hebrides,
and Man. They also colonized the eastern
coast of Ireland, where they were known as <i>Ostmen</i>.
And it was from Norway also that the settlers came by
which the coast of France in the strictest sense, the
French duchy, was cut off from the dominion of Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
to form the Duchy of Normandy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>England
and Denmark.
789-1017.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the chief field
for the energy of Denmark properly so called lay
within the limits of that part of Britain which we may
now begin to call <i>England</i>. It was during this period
that the united English kingdom grew up, that the
many English settlements in Britain coalesced into one
English nation. And this work was in a singular way
promoted by the very cause, namely, the Danish invasions,
which seemed best suited to hinder it.</p>

<p>Up to this time the great island had been in truth,
as it was often called, another world, influencing but
little, and but little influenced by, any of the lands
which formed part of either of the continental Empires.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formation
of the
Kingdom of
England.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The English history of these times, a history which is
specially connected with geography, consists of two
great facts. The first is the union of all the English states
in Britain into one English kingdom under the West-Saxon
kings. The other is the establishment of a vague
supremacy on the part of those kings over the whole
island.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>West-Saxon
supremacy
under
Ecgberht.
825-830.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dominion established by Ecgberht was in
no sense a kingdom of England. It consisted simply
in a supremacy on the part of the West-Saxon king
over all the princes of Britain, Teutonic and Celtic,
save only the Picts, Scots, and Welsh of Strathclyde or
Cumberland. The smaller kingdoms of Kent, Sussex,
and Essex formed appanages for West-Saxon <i>æthelings</i>;
but the superiority over East-Anglia, Mercia,
Northumberland, and the Welsh princes was purely
external. The change of this power into an united
English kingdom holding a supremacy over the whole
island was largely helped by the Danish incursions
and settlements.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Danish
invasions.
789.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These incursions began in the last
years of the eighth century; they became more frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
and more dangerous in the middle of the ninth;
and in the latter part of that century they grew from
mere incursions into actual settlements. This was the
result of the great struggle in the days of the first
Æthelred and his more famous brother Ælfred.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division
between
Ælfred and
Guthrum.
878.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By
Ælfred’s treaty with the Danish Guthrum, the West-Saxon
king kept his own West-Saxon kingdom and all
the other lands south of the Thames, together with
western Mercia. The rest of Mercia, with East-Anglia
and <i>Deira</i> or southern Northumberland, passed under
Danish rule.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bernicia
not Danish.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Bernicia</i>, or northern Northumberland
from the Tees to the Forth, still kept its Anglian princes,
seemingly under Danish supremacy. Over the lands
which thus became Danish the West-Saxon king kept
a mere nominal and precarious supremacy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Scandinavian
settlements
in
Cumberland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Scotland
and Strathclyde the succession of the Celtic
princes was not disturbed; but in part at least of
Strathclyde, in the more modern Cumberland, a large
Scandinavian population, though probably Norwegian
rather than Danish, must have settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Increase of
the immediate
kingdom
of
Wessex.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By these changes the power of the West-Saxon
king as an over-lord was greatly cut short, while his
immediate kingdom was enlarged. The dynasty which
had come so near to the supremacy of the whole island
seemed to be again shut up in its own kingdom and
the lands immediately bordering on it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second
West-Saxon
advance.
910-954.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, by overthrowing
the other English kingdoms, the Danes had
prepared the way for the second West-Saxon advance
in the tenth century. Saxon king was now
the only English king, and he further became the
English and Christian champion against intruders who
largely remained heathen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wessex
grows into
England.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The work of the first half
of the tenth century was to enlarge the Kingdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
Wessex into the Kingdom of England. Eadward the
Elder, King, not merely of the West-Saxons but of the
English, extended his immediate frontier, the frontier
of the one English kingdom, to the Humber.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>First submission
of
Scotland
and Strathclyde.
923.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Wales,
Northumberland, English and Danish, and now, for the
first time, Scotland and Strathclyde, all acknowledged
the English supremacy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>926.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Under Æthelstan Northumberland
was for the first time incorporated with the
kingdom, and after several revolts and reconquests,
it finally became an integral part of England, forming
sometimes one, sometimes two, English earldoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cumberland
granted as
a fief to
Scotland.
945.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile Cumberland was subdued by Eadmund,
and was given as a fief to the Kings of Scots, who
commonly granted it as an appanage to their sons.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lothian
granted to
Scotland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile, partly, it would seem, by conquest, partly
by cession, the Scottish kings became possessed of the
northern part of Northumberland, under the name of
the earldom of Lothian. Thus, in the second half of
the tenth century, a single kingdom of England had
been formed, of which the Welsh principalities, as well
as Scotland, Strathclyde, and Lothian, were vassal states.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The English
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">Thus the English kingdom was formed, and with it
the English Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
Imperial
titles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
For the English kings in the
tenth and eleventh centuries, acknowledging no superiority
in the Cæsar either of East or West and
holding within their own island a position analogous to
that of the Emperors on the mainland, did not scruple
to assume the Imperial title, and to speak of themselves
as Emperors of the other world of Britain. The
kingdom and Empire thus formed were transferred
by the wars of Swegen and Cnut from a West-Saxon
to a Danish king.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Northern
Empire of
Cnut.
1016-1035.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Under Cnut England was for a
moment the chief seat, and Winchester the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
city, of a Northern Empire which might fairly claim
a place alongside of the Old and the New Rome.
England, Denmark, Norway, had a single king, whose
supremacy extended further over the rest of Britain,
over Sweden and a large part of the Baltic coast.
That Empire split in pieces on his death. The Scandinavian
kingdoms were again separated; England itself
was divided for a moment.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Norman
Conquest.
1066-70.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The kingdom, again reunited,
first passed back to the West-Saxon house, and
then, by a second conquest, to the Norman. After this
last revolution a division of the kingdom was never
more heard of.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>England
finally
united by
William.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
William the Conqueror put the finishing
stroke to the work of Ecgberht, and made England
for ever one. And, by uniting England under the same
ruler as Normandy, and by thus leading her into the
general current of continental affairs, he gave her an
European position such as she had never held under
her native kings.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Summary.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By the end of the eleventh century then the chief
nations of Europe had been formed. The Western
Empire, after many shiftings, had taken a definite
shape.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Western
Empire
and the
Imperial
Kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Imperial dignity and the two royal crowns
of Italy and Burgundy were now attached to the
German kingdom. The Empire, in short, though
keeping its Roman titles and associations, and with
them its influence over the minds of men, had practically
become a German power. Its history from this
time mainly consists in the steps by which the German
Emperors of Rome lost their hold on their Italian and
Burgundian kingdoms, and of the steps by which the
German dominion was extended over the Slaves to the
East.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the West the Western Kingdom has altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
detached itself from the Empire; the union of its
crown with the Duchy of France has created the
French kingdom and nation, with its centre at Paris,
and with a supremacy, as yet little more than nominal,
over a large part of Gaul.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the Western Empire
has become German, the Eastern Empire has become
Greek; in the early years of the eleventh century it again
forms a powerful and compact state, ruling from Naples
to Antioch.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Slavonic
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of the states to the north of it, Bulgaria
has been reincorporated with the Empire; Servia,
Hungary, Russia, have taken their definite position
among the Christian powers of Europe. So have Poland
and Bohemia on the borders of the Western Empire.
Prussia, Lithuania, and the Finnish lands to the immediate
north of them remain heathen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Spain, the
Christians have won back a large part of the peninsula.
Castile and Navarre are already kingdoms; Aragon,
though not yet a kingdom, has begun her history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Scandinavian
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In
Northern Europe, the three Scandinavian nations are
clearly distinguished and firmly established.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>England
and Normandy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Within the
isle of Britain the kingdoms of England and Scotland
have been formed, and the union of England and Normandy
under a single prince has opened the way to
altogether new relations between the continent and the
great island. In short, the only European powers which
play a part in strictly mediæval history which are not
yet formed are Portugal and the Sicilian kingdoms.</p>

<p>From this point then, when most of the European
powers have come into being, and when the two
Roman Empires are fast becoming a German and a
Greek power alongside of other powers, it will be well
to change the form of our present inquiry. Thus far
we have treated the historical geography of Europe as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
whole, gathering round two centres at the Old and the
New Rome. It will henceforth be more convenient
to take the history of the great divisions of Europe
separately, and to trace out in distinct chapters the
changes which the boundaries of each have gone
through from the eleventh century to our own time.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ecclesiastical
geography.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But before we enter on these several national divisions,
it will be well to take a view of the ecclesiastical
divisions of Western Christendom, which are of great
importance and which are constantly referred to in the
times with which we are now concerned.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE ECCLESIASTICAL GEOGRAPHY OF WESTERN EUROPE.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
of ecclesiastical
geography.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ecclesiastical geography of Western Europe was
by this time formed. The great ecclesiastical divisions
were now almost everywhere mapped out, and from
hence they are more permanent than the political divisions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Permanence
of
the ecclesiastical
divisions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The ecclesiastical geography in truth constantly
preserves an earlier political geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>They represent
older
civil divisions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The ecclesiastical
divisions were always mapped out according
to the political divisions of the time when they were
established, and they often remained unaltered while
the political divisions went through many revolutions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Illustrations
from
England
and France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus in France the dioceses represented the jurisdictions
of the Roman cities; in England they represented
the ancient English kingdoms and principalities.
In both cases they outlived by many ages the
political divisions which they represented. While the
political map was altered over and over again, the
ecclesiastical map remained down to quite modern
times, with hardly any change beyond the occasional
division of a large diocese or the occasional union
of two smaller dioceses. Thus the greater permanence
of the ecclesiastical map often makes it useful as a
standard for reference in describing political changes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lyons and
Rheims.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To take an instance, the city of Lyons has been at
different times under Burgundian and under Frankish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
kings; it has been a free city of the Empire and a city
of the modern kingdom of France. But, among all
these changes, the Archbishop of Lyons has always
remained Primate of all the Gauls, while the Archbishop
of Rheims has held a wholly different position
alongside of him as first prelate and first peer of the
modern kingdom of France. Paris meanwhile, the
political capital of the modern kingdom, remained till
the seventeenth century the seat of a simple bishoprick.</p>

<p>In this way the ecclesiastical division will be found
almost everywhere to keep up the remembrance of an
earlier political state of things.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Patriarchates,
Provinces,
Dioceses.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the Empire became
Christian, it was mapped out into <i>Patriarchates</i> as well
as into Prefectures. Under these were the metropolitan
and episcopal districts, which in after-times
borrowed, though in a reverse order of dignity, the
civil titles of <i>provinces</i> and <i>dioceses</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Divisions
within and
without the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the Church
carried her spiritual conquests beyond the bounds of
the Empire, new ecclesiastical districts were of course
formed in the newly converted countries. As a rule,
every kingdom had at least one archbishopric; the
smaller principalities, provinces, or other divisions became
the dioceses of bishops. But the different social
conditions of southern and northern Europe caused a
marked difference in the ecclesiastical arrangements of
the two regions. In the South the bishop was bishop of
a city; in the North he was bishop of a tribe or a district.
Within the Empire each city had its bishop. Thus in
Italy and Southern Gaul, where the cities were thickest
on the ground, the bishops were most numerous and
their dioceses were smallest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bishops of
cities and
of tribes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Northern Gaul the cities
are fewer and the dioceses larger, while outside the
Empire, the dioceses which represented a tribe or principality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
were larger again. Also again, within the
Empire the bishop, as bishop of a city, always took
his title from the city; outside the Empire, especially
in the British islands both Celtic and Teutonic, the
bishop of a tribe or principality bore a tribal or territorial
title.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>The Great Patriarchates.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Patriarchates
suggested
by the Prefectures.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The highest ecclesiastical divisions, the Patriarchates,
though they did not exactly answer to the Prefectures,
were clearly suggested by them. And whenever the
boundaries of the Patriarchates departed from the
boundaries of the Prefectures, they came nearer to the
great divisions of race and language. For our purpose,
it is enough to take the Patriarchates, as they grew up,
after the establishment of Christianity, in the course of
the fourth and fifth centuries. The four older ones
were seated at the <i>Old</i> and the <i>New Rome</i>, and at the
two great Eastern cities of <i>Antioch</i> and <i>Alexandria</i>. Out
of the patriarchate of Antioch the small patriarchate of
<i>Jerusalem</i> was afterwards taken. This last seems a piece
of sentimental geography; the other divisions were
eminently practical.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Whether we look on the original
jurisdiction of the Bishop of the Old <i>Rome</i> as taking in
the whole <i>prefecture</i> of Italy or only the <i>diocese</i> of
Italy, it is certain that it was gradually extended over
the two prefectures of Italy and Gaul.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extended
beyond the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
That is, it took
in the Latin part of the Empire, and it spread thence
over the Teutonic converts in the West, as well as
over Hungary and the Western Slaves.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Constantinople.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Patriarchate
of <i>Constantinople</i> or New Rome took in the
Prefecture of Illyricum, and three dioceses in the
Prefecture of the East, those of Thrace, Asia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
Pontus. This territory pretty well answers to the
extent of the Greek language and influence. The two
Illyrian dioceses, possibly through some confusion arising
out of the two meanings of the word <i>Illyricum</i>,
were claimed by the Popes of Old Rome; but, when
the Empires and Churches parted asunder, Macedonia
and Greece were not likely to cleave to the Western
division.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its relation
to the Eastern
Empire
and to the
Slaves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In course of time the Byzantine patriarchate
became nearly coextensive with the Byzantine Empire,
and it became the centre of conversion to the Slaves
of the East, just as the patriarchate of Old Rome was to
the Teutons of the West.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Antioch.<br />Jerusalem.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The patriarchate of <i>Antioch</i>,
before its dismemberment in favour of the tiny patriarchate
of <i>Jerusalem</i>, took in the whole diocese of the
East, and the churches beyond the limits of the Empire
in that direction.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Alexandria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The patriarchate of <i>Alexandria</i>
answered to the diocese of Egypt, with the churches
beyond the Empire on that side, specially the <i>Abyssinian</i>
church, which has kept its nationality to our own time.
That these Eastern patriarchates have been for ages
disputed by claimants belonging to different sects of
Christianity is a fact which concerns both theology and
history, but does not concern geography. Whether
the see was in Orthodox or heretical—that is commonly
in national—hands, the see and its diocese, the geographical
extent on the map, remained the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Later nominal
patriarchates.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These then are the five great patriarchates which
formed the most ancient geographical divisions of the
Church. In later times the name patriarchate has
been more loosely applied. As the Roman bishop
grew into something more than the Patriarch of the
West, the title of Patriarch was given to several metropolitans,
sometimes, as far as one can see, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
particular reason.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lisbon,
Venice,
Aquileia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The title has been borne by the
Bishops of <i>Lisbon</i> and <i>Venice</i>, and specially by the
Metropolitans of <i>Aquileia</i>. These last assumed the
title during a time of separation from the Roman see.
But nominal patriarchates of this kind must be carefully
distinguished from the five great churches to
which the name was anciently attached.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Patriarchate
of
Moscow.
1587.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the East
the name was never extended beyond its four original
holders, till a new patriarchate of <i>Moscow</i> arose in
Russia, to mark the greatest spiritual conquest of the
Orthodox Church. Of the four original Eastern patriarchates
it is only that of Constantinople which plays
much part in later history. The seats of the other
three fell into the hands of the Saracens in the very
beginning of their conquests.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>The Ecclesiastical Divisions of Italy.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Great
numbers of
the Italian
bishoprics.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In no part of Christendom do the bishoprics lie so
thick upon the ground as in Italy, and especially in the
southern part. But from that very fact it follows that
the ecclesiastical divisions of Italy are of less historical
importance than those of most other Western countries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Small size
of the
provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In southern Italy above all, the bishoprics were so
numerous, and the dioceses therefore so small, that the
archiepiscopal provinces were hardly so large as the
episcopal dioceses in more northern lands. So it is
in the islands; Sicily contained four provinces and
Sardinia three.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of
the commonwealths
on the position
of the
prelates.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The peculiar characteristics of Italian
history also hindered ecclesiastical geography from
being of the same importance as elsewhere. Where
every city became an independent commonwealth, the
Bishop, and even the Metropolitan, sank to a lower
rank than they held in the lands where each prelate
was a great feudal lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span></p>

<p>It follows then that there are only a few of the archbishoprics
and bishoprics of Italy which at all stand
out in general history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relation to
the Roman
See.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The growth of the Roman see
also more distinctly overshadowed the Italian bishops
than it did those of other lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivals of
Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The bishoprics which
have most historical importance are those which at one
time or another stood out in rivalry or opposition to
Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Milan.<br />
Aquileia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Such was the great see of <i>Milan</i>, whose province
took in a crowd of Lombard bishoprics;
such was the
patriarchal see of <i>Aquileia</i>, whose metropolitan jurisdiction
took in Como at one end and the Istrian Pola
at the other. The patriarchs of Aquileia, standing as
they did on the march of the Italian, Teutonic, and
Slavonic lands, grew, unlike most of the Italian prelates,
into powerful temporal princes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ravenna.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Ravenna</i> was the
head of a smaller province than either Milan or Aquileia;
but <i>Ravenna</i> too stands out as one of the churches
which kept up for a while an independent position in
the face of the growing power of Rome. Milan and
Ravenna, in short, never lost the memory of their
Imperial days; and Aquileia took advantage, first of a
theological difference, and secondly of its temporal
position as the great border see.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The immediate
Roman
Province.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the rest of Italy the case is different. Rome
herself was the immediate head of a large province
stretching from sea to sea. Within this the <i>suburbicarian</i>
sees, those close around Rome, stood in a special
and closer relation to the patriarchal see itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Metropolitan
sees of
central
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
famous cities of <i>Genoa</i>, <i>Bologna</i>, <i>Pisa</i>, <i>Florence</i>, and
<i>Sienna</i>, were also metropolitan sees, though their ecclesiastical
dignity is quite overshadowed by their civic
greatness. <i>Lucca</i> has been added to the same list in
modern times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pisa and
Genoa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The provinces of Pisa and Genoa are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
notable as having been extended into the island of
Corsica after its recovery from the Saracens. The history
and extent of the Italian dioceses is, with these few
exceptions, a matter almost wholly of local ecclesiastical
concern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
southern
province.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the south and in Sicily the endless archiepiscopal
sees preserve the names of some famous cities,
as <i>Capua</i>—the later Capua on the site of Casilinum—<i>Tarentum</i>,
<i>Bari</i>, and others. But some even of the metropolitan
churches are fixed in places of quite secondary
importance, and the simple bishoprics are endless.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>The Ecclesiastical Divisions of Gaul and Germany.</i></h3>

<p>By taking a single view of the ecclesiastical arrangements
of the whole of the Western Empire on this side
of the Alps and the Pyrenees, some instructive lessons
may be learned. Such a way of looking at the map
will bring out more strongly the differences between
bishoprics of earlier and later foundation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gaulish and
German
dioceses.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, if we
take the name of Gaul in the old geographical sense,
taking in the German lands west of the Rhine which
formed part of the older Empire, we shall find that
several ecclesiastical provinces may be called either
Gaulish or German. With the boundaries of the French
kingdom we have no concern, except so far as the
boundary between the Eastern and Western kingdoms
of the Franks did to some extent follow ecclesiastical
lines. Modern annexations of course have had no
regard to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Province of
South Gaul.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On first crossing the Alps from Italy, we find the
ecclesiastical phænomena of Italy continued in the lands
nearest to it. The two provinces of <i>Tarantaise</i> (answering
to the civil division of <i>Alpes Penninæ</i>) and <i>Embrun</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
(<i>Alpes Maritimæ</i>) which take in the mountain region
between Italy and Gaul, are of small size, though of
course in the actual mountain lands the bishoprics are
less thick on the ground.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tarantaise.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Tarantasian province contained
only three suffragan sees, <i>Sitten</i>, <i>Aosta</i>, and <i>St.
John of Maurienne</i>, three bishoprics which now belong
to three distinct political powers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Embrun.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But in the southern
part of the province of Embrun, which reaches to the
sea, the bishops’ sees are thick on the ground, just as
they are in Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Aix and
Arles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
So they are in the small provinces
of <i>Aix</i> (<i>Narbonensis Secunda</i>) and <i>Arles</i>. But, as soon
as we get out of Provence into the parts of Gaul which
were less thoroughly Romanized, and where cities, and
consequently bishoprics, lay less close together, the
phænomena of the ecclesiastical map begin to change.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Vienne.<br />
Narbonne.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Provençal provinces of Aix and Aries are bounded
to the north and west by those of <i>Vienne</i> (which with
Arles answers nearly to the civil <i>Viennensis</i>)
and
<i>Narbonne</i> (answering nearly to <i>Narbonensis Secunda</i>).
These provinces are of much greater size, and the
suffragan sees are much further apart.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Auch.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the west lies
<i>Auch</i>, answering to the oldest Aquitaine or <i>Novempopulana</i>,
and to the north of these, in the remainder of
Gaul, the original provinces are of still greater size.
Most of them answer very nearly to the older civil
divisions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bourges,
Bourdeaux,
Lyons,
Rouen,
Tours, and
Sens.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Aquitania Prima</i> is the province of <i>Bourges</i>,
<i>Aquitania Secunda</i> that of <i>Bourdeaux</i>. <i>Lugdunensis
Prima</i>, <i>Secunda</i>, <i>Tertia</i>, and <i>Quarta</i>, answer to <i>Lyons</i>,
<i>Rouen</i>, <i>Tours</i>, and <i>Sens</i>. Of these Lyons, as having
been the temporal capital, became the seat of the Primate
of all the Gauls. The province of Rouen too answers
very nearly to the duchy of which that metropolis
became the capital; its Archbishop still bears the title
of Primate of Normandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span></p>

<p class="pb2">These are the oldest ecclesiastical arrangements,
closely following the civil divisions of the Empire. These
divisions lived through the Teutonic conquests; and,
though here and there a see was translated from one city
to another, they were not seriously interfered with till the
fourteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Foundation
of the provinces
of
Toulouse
and Alby,
1322.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Pope John the Twenty-second raised
the see of <i>Toulouse</i> in the province of Narbonne and
that of <i>Alby</i> in the province of Bourges to metropolitan
rank, thus forming two new provinces. He also
founded new bishoprics in several towns in these two
new provinces and in that of Narbonne.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Avignon,
1475.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the next
century Sixtus the Fourth made the church of <i>Avignon</i>
metropolitan. These changes help to give this whole
district more of the character of Italy and Provence
than originally belonged to it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Paris, 1622.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, in the seventeenth
century the province of <i>Sens</i> was also divided,
and the church of <i>Paris</i> became metropolitan. Some
of these changes show how closely the ecclesiastical
divisions followed the oldest civil divisions, and how
slowly they were affected by changes in the civil divisions.
When Gaul was first mapped out, Tolosa was
of less account than Narbo; the Parisii and their city
were of less account than the great nation of the
<i>Senones</i>. Tolosa became the royal city of the Goth;
but it did not rise to the highest ecclesiastical rank till
ages after the Gothic kingdom had passed away. Paris,
after having been several times a momentary seat of
dominion, became the birthplace of the modern French
kingdom. But it had been the continuous seat of kings
for more than six hundred years before it became the
seat of an archbishop.</p>


<p>As we draw nearer to German ground, the ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
boundaries are found to have been somewhat
more strongly affected by political changes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Besançon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
ecclesiastical province of <i>Besançon</i> answers to <i>Maxima
Sequanorum</i>; but it is not quite of the same extent;
the boundary of the German and Burgundian kingdoms
passed through the Roman province: its eastern part
is therefore found in a German diocese.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rheims.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The province
of <i>Rheims</i> answers nearly, but not quite, to <i>Belgica Secunda</i>:
for the ecclesiastical province took in some territory
to the east of the Scheld. Here again the boundary
of the Eastern and Western kingdoms passed through the
province. The metropolitan city lay within the region
which became the kingdom of France, and it became
the ecclesiastical head of the kingdom. Yet one of
its suffragan sees, that of <i>Cambray</i>, was a city of the
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Trier, 785.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The province of <i>Trier</i> took in no part of
the Western kingdom; but, besides the old province
of <i>Belgica Prima</i>, it stretched away over the German
lands even beyond the Rhine.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Köln, 785.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
When the old Gaulish
bishoprick of <i>Colonia Agrippina</i> became metropolitan
under Charles the Great, its province took
in nearly all the old Gaulish province of <i>Germania
Secunda</i>; but it too came to stretch beyond the Rhine
and beyond the Weser. These two metropolitan sees,
Trier and Köln, were old Gaulish bishopricks of the
frontier land.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mainz, 747.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The see of <i>Mainz</i> has no certain historical
being before Boniface in the eighth century. It
too was founded on what was geographically Gaulish
soil; but the greater part of its vast extent was strictly
German. Three only of its suffragans, <i>Worms</i>, <i>Speyer</i>,
and <i>Argentoratum</i> or <i>Strassburg</i>, were even geographically
Gaulish. No province has had more fluctuating
boundaries: the elevation of Köln to metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
rank cut it short to the west, while it grew indefinitely
to the north, south, and east, as its boundaries were
enlarged by conversion and conquest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prag, 1344.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the east it
was cut short in the fourteenth century when the kingdom
of Bohemia and its dependencies were formed into
the ecclesiastical province of <i>Prag</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bamberg,
1007.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The famous bishoprick
of <i>Bamberg</i>, locally in the province of Mainz, was
from the beginning immediately dependent on the see
of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The three
ecclesiastical
Electors
and Arch-chancellors.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These three great archbishopricks of the frontier
land, all of whose sees were on the Gaulish side of the
Rhine, remained distinguished by their temporal rank
during the whole life of the German kingdom. All
the German prelates became princes; but only these
three were Electors. The prelates of these three were the
Arch-chancellors of the three Imperial kingdoms, Mainz
of Germany, Köln of Italy, Trier of Gaul. But, as the
Frankish or German kingdom spread to the north-east,
new ecclesiastical provinces were formed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Salzburg,
798.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The bishoprick
of <i>Salzburg</i> became metropolitan under Charles the
Great, with a province stretching away to the East
towards his conquests from the Avars.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bremen or
Hamburg,
788.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The bishoprick
of <i>Bremen</i>, another foundation of Charles the Great, was
transferred under his son to <i>Hamburg</i>, as a metropolitan
see which was designed to be a missionary centre for
the Scandinavian nations.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1223.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After some fluctuations,
the see was finally settled at Bremen, as the metropolis
of a province, which had now become in no way
Scandinavian, but partly Old-Saxon, partly Wendish.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Magdeburg,
968.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, Otto the Great founded the metropolitan see
of <i>Magdeburg</i> on the Slavonic march. Thus the
German kingdom formed six ecclesiastical provinces,
all of vast extent as compared with those of Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
Europe, and with their suffragan sees few and far
apart. The difference is here clearly marked between
the earlier sees which arose from the very
beginning in the Roman cities, and the sees of later
foundation which were gradually founded as new lands
were brought under the dominion of the Empire and
the Church. Still the old tradition went on so far that
each Bishop had his see in a city, and took his name
from that city. Though the German dioceses were of
large extent, yet none of the German bishoprics were
in strictness territorial.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Modern ecclesiastical
divisions of
Germany
and France.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In no part of Christendom have the ecclesiastical
divisions been more completely upset in modern times
than they have been in Germany. In France the
number of dioceses was greatly lessened by the <i>Concordat</i>
under the first Buonaparte; but the main ecclesiastical
landmarks were to a great extent respected.
In Germany, on the other hand, no trace of them is left.
The country has been mapped out afresh to suit the
boundaries of patched-up modern kingdoms. Mainz
and Trier are no longer metropolitan sees, while the
modern map shows such novelties as an Archbishop of
München and an Archbishop of Freiburg.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes of

Long before,
under Philip the Second of Spain, those parts of the
German kingdom which had become practically detached

change in their ecclesiastical divisions.

Mechlin,
Utrecht.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Cambray</i> and
<i>Mechlin</i> in the province of Rheims, and <i>Utrecht</i> in the
province of Köln, became metropolitan sees. Modern
political changes have made these three cities members
of three distinct political powers.</p>

<h3>§ 4. <i>The Ecclesiastical Divisions of Spain.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Peculiarities
of
Spanish ecclesiastical
geography.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The ecclesiastical history of the Spanish peninsula
presents phænomena of a different kind from those of
Italy, Gaul, or Germany. In Italy and Gaul the
ecclesiastical divisions go on uninterruptedly from the
earliest days of Christianity. Western Germany must
count for these purposes as part of Gaul. In eastern
Germany the ecclesiastical divisions were formed in
later times, as Christianity was spread over the country.
In Spain the country must have been mapped out for
ecclesiastical purposes at least as early as Gaul.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Old divisions
lost,
and mapped
out afresh
after the recovery
from
the Saracens.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the
Mahometan conquest of the greater part of the country,
followed by the Christian reconquest, caused the old ecclesiastical
lines to be wiped out, and new divisions had to
be traced out afresh as the land was gradually won back.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ecclesiastical
divisions
under
the West-Goths.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The ecclesiastical divisions of Spain in the time of the
Gothic kingdom simply reproduce the civil divisions
of the period, as those civil divisions are only a slight
modification of the Roman provinces. <i>Lusitania</i> and
<i>Bætica</i> survived, with a slight change of frontier, both
as civil and as ecclesiastical divisions. <i>Tarraconensis</i>
was for both purposes divided into three, <i>Tarraconensis</i>,
<i>Carthagenensis</i>, and <i>Gallæcia</i>. As the land was won
back, and as new ecclesiastical provinces were formed,
the number was greatly increased, and some of them
found their way to new sites.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tarragona,
Zaragoza,
Valencia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus the Tarraconensian
province was again divided into three, those of <i>Tarragona</i>,
<i>Zaragoza</i>, and <i>Valencia</i>, answering nearly to the
kingdom of Aragon.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Toledo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
New Carthage lost its metropolitan
rank in favour of the great metropolis of
<i>Toledo</i>, which numbered <i>Cordova</i> and <i>Valladolid</i> among
its suffragans.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Compostella,
Burgos,
Seville,
and
Granada.<br />
Braga,
Evora,
Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Leaving out some anomalous districts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
the rest of the peninsula formed the provinces of St.
James of <i>Compostella</i>, <i>Burgos</i>, <i>Seville</i>, <i>Granada</i>, with
<i>Braga</i>, <i>Evora</i>, and the patriarchal see of <i>Lisbon</i>, the
last three answering to the kingdom of Portugal. And
it must be remembered that the Pyrenees did not form
an eternal boundary in ecclesiastical, any more than in
civil geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dioceses of
Pampeluna
and Bayonne.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the kingdom of Navarre stretched
on both sides of the mountains, so did the diocese of
<i>Pampeluna</i>; and to the west of it the Gaulish diocese
of <i>Bayonne</i> stretched on what is now Spanish ground.
All these are survivals of a time when, to use the phrase
of a later day, there were no Pyrenees, or when at least
the same rulers, first Gothic and then Saracen, reigned
on both sides of them.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>The Ecclesiastical Divisions of the British Islands.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The British
islands.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The historical phænomena of the British islands have
points in common with more than one of the continental
countries. In a very rough and general view of things,
Britain has some analogies with Spain. It is not altogether
without reason that in some legendary stories the
names of Saxons and Saracens get confounded. In both
cases a land which had been Christian was overrun by
conquerors of another creed; in both a Christian people
held their ground in a part of the country; and in both
the whole land was won back to Christianity, though
by different and even opposite processes in the two
cases.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Celtic
episcopate.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But there is no reason to believe that the Celtic
churches in Britain and Ireland had anything like the
same complete ecclesiastical organization as the Spanish
churches under the Goths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tribal
episcopacy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Celtic episcopate was
of an irregular and anomalous kind, and, in its most
intelligible shape, it was, as was natural under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
circumstances of the country, not a city episcopate,
hardly a territorial episcopate, but one strictly tribal.
This is nearly the only fact in the history of the early
Celtic churches which is of any importance for our
purpose. It might be too much to say that traces
of this peculiarity were handed on from the Celtic to
the English Church. The little likeness that there is
between them is rather due to the fact that in
Northern Europe generally, whether Celtic or Teutonic,
a strictly city episcopate like that of Italy and Gaul
was something which in the nature of things could
not be.</p>

<p>In truth the antiquities of the Celtic churches may
fairly be left to be matter of local or of special ecclesiastical
inquiry. Their effect on history is slight; their
effect on historical geography is still slighter. For
our purpose the ecclesiastical geography of Britain may
be looked on as beginning with the mission of Augustine.
The English Church was formed, and the Welsh,
Scottish, and Irish Churches were reconstructed, partly
under its authority, altogether after its model.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Schemes of
Gregory the
Great.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the
original scheme of Gregory the Great, Britain was clearly
meant to be divided into two ecclesiastical provinces
nearly equal in extent.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Two equal
provinces in
Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Celtic churches were to be
brought under the same ecclesiastical obedience as the
heathen English. As Wales was to form part of the
lot of the southern metropolitan, so Scotland was to
form part of the lot of the northern. This scheme was
never fully carried out. Wales was indeed brought
into full submission to Canterbury; but Scotland was
never brought into the same full submission to York.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relation of
the Scottish
Bishops to
York.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The allegiance of the Scottish sees to their Northumbrian
metropolis was at all times very precarious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
it was in the end formally thrown off altogether.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suffragan
sees of
Canterbury
and York.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of
this came the singular disproportion in the territorial
extent of the two English ecclesiastical provinces.
Canterbury, since the English Church was thoroughly
organized, has had a number of suffragans which would
be unusual anywhere on the continent, while York has
always had comparatively few, and for a considerable
time had practically one only.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Foundation
of the
existing
dioceses.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The systematic mapping out of Britain for ecclesiastical
purposes, as designed by Gregory, was therefore
never fully carried out. The actual provinces and
dioceses were gradually formed, as the various English
existing kingdoms embraced Christianity. As a rule,
each kingdom or independent principality became a diocese.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Territorial
bishoprics<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, except in the case of a few sees fixed in cities
which kept on something of old Roman memories, the
bishops were more commonly called from the people
who formed their flock, than from the cities which in
some cases contained their chairs. For in many cases
the <i>bishop-settle</i>, as our forefathers called it, was
not placed in a city at all, but in some rural or even
solitary spot. It was not till the time of the Norman
Conquest that a movement began for systematically
placing the ecclesiastical sees in the chief towns;
from that time the civic title altogether displaces the
territorial.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Canterbury.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>As Kent was the first part of Teutonic Britain to
accept Christianity, the metropolitan see of the south
was fixed at <i>Canterbury</i>, the capital of that kingdom.
It was thus fixed in a city which has at no time held
that temporal preeminence which has in different ages
belonged to York, Winchester, and London.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rochester.<br />
London.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After
Canterbury the earliest formed sees were <i>Rochester</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
the West-Kentish kingdom, and <i>London</i> for the East-Saxons.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dorchester
or Winchester.
Sherborne,
Wells,
Ramsbury.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The conversion of the West-Saxons led to the
foundation of the great diocese whose see was first at
<i>Dorchester</i> on the Thames and then at <i>Winchester</i>, and
from which the sees of <i>Sherborne</i>, <i>Wells</i>, and <i>Ramsbury</i>
were gradually parted off.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Elmham.<br />
Dorchester
or Lincoln.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The East-Angles formed a
diocese with its see at <i>Elmham</i>;
the Middle-Angles
settled down, after some shiftings, into the vast diocese
stretching from the Thames to the Humber, whose see,
first at <i>Dorchester</i>, was afterwards translated to <i>Lincoln</i>.

The West-Mercian lands formed the dioceses of the
Hwiccas at <i>Worcester</i>, of the Magesætas at <i>Hereford</i>,
and the great diocese of <i>Lichfield</i>, stretching northward
to the Ribble. The South-Saxons, whose see kept its

To the
times just before and just after the Conquest belong
the union of Sherborne and Ramsbury to form the
diocese of <i>Salisbury</i>, and the dismemberment of the
huge diocese of Lincoln by the foundation of an episcopal
see at <i>Ely</i>. Thus the province of Canterbury
with its suffragan sees was gradually organized in the
form which it kept from the reign of Henry the First
to that of Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the northern province things never
reached the same regular organization.

York, after

As the Scottish

of <i>Ulster</i>, <i>Leinster</i>, <i>Munster</i>, and <i>Connaught</i>. It is to
be noticed that, in marked contradiction to continental
practice, the chief see in all the three British kingdoms
has been placed in a city which has never held the first
temporal rank. Canterbury, St. Andrews, Armagh,
were never the temporal heads of England, Scotland,
and Ireland. York, Dublin, Glasgow, though metropolitan
sees, were of secondary rank, and London and
Winchester were ordinary bishoprics.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>The Ecclesiastical Divisions of Northern and Eastern Europe.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ecclesiastical
division
in the converted
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the other parts of Europe which formed part
of the communion of the Latin Church, the ecclesiastical
divisions mark the steps by which Christianity
was spread either by conversion or conquest. They
continued the process of which the ecclesiastical organization
of Eastern Germany was the beginning. As
a rule, they strictly follow the political divisions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
age in which they were founded.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Scandinavian
provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the Church in
the Scandinavian kingdoms became more settled, its
bishoprics parted off from their allegiance to Hamburg
or Bremen, and each of the three kingdoms formed
an ecclesiastical province, whose boundaries exactly
answered to the earlier boundaries of the kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lund,
1151.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Denmark had its metropolitan see at <i>Lund</i>, in that part of
the Danish kingdom which geographically forms part
of the greater Scandinavian peninsula, and which is now
Swedish territory. Its boundary to the south was the
Eider, the old frontier of Denmark and the Empire.
The suffragan sees of this province, among which the
specially royal bishopric of <i>Roeskild</i> is the most famous,
naturally lie thicker on the ground than they do in
the wilder regions of the two more northern kingdoms.
But the Baltic conquests of Denmark also placed part
of the isle of Rügen in the province of Lund and
the diocese of Roeskild, and also gave the Danish
metropolitan a far more distant suffragan in the Bishop
of <i>Revel</i> on the Finnish gulf.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Upsala.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The metropolitan see of
Sweden was placed at <i>Upsala</i>, and the province was
carried by Swedish conquest to the east of the Gulf of
Bothnia, where the single bishopric of <i>Abo</i> took in the
whole of the Swedish territory in that region.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Trondhjem.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In
the like sort, the Norwegian province of <i>Nidaros</i> or
<i>Trondhjem</i> stretched far over the Ocean to the distant
Colonies and dependencies of Norway in Iceland, Greenland,
and Man.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Poland, &amp;c.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The conversion of Poland and the conquest of
Prussia and Livonia brought other lands within the pale
of the Latin Church and her ecclesiastical organization.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gnezna.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The original kingdom of Poland formed the province of
<i>Gnezna</i>, a province whose boundaries were for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
centuries very fluctuating, according as Poland or the
Empire was stronger in the Slavonic lands on the
Baltic. Each change of temporal dominion caused
the ecclesiastical frontiers of Gnezna and Magdeburg
to advance or fall back. The Silesian bishopric of
<i>Breslau</i> always kept its old relation to the Polish metropolis,
except so far as it was held to be placed under
the immediate superiority of Rome. The later union of
Lithuania to the Polish kingdom added a <i>Lithuanian</i>
and a <i>Samogitian</i> bishopric to the original Polish
province.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Riga.<br />
Leopol.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The earlier Polish conquests from Russia
formed a new province,
the Latin province of <i>Leopol</i>
or <i>Lemberg</i>, a province whose southern boundaries advanced
and fell back along with the boundary of the
kingdom of which it formed a part. The conquests of
the Teutonic knights in Prussia and Livonia formed the
ecclesiastical province of <i>Riga</i>, which was divided into
two parts by the province of Gnezna in its greater
extent.</p>


<p class="p2">It will be seen that some of the ecclesiastical divisions
last mentioned belong to a later stage of European
history than the point which we have reached in our
general narrative. But it seemed better to continue
the survey over the whole of the Latin Church in
Europe, as the later foundations are a mere carrying
out of the same process which began in the earlier. The
ecclesiastical divisions represent the political divisions
of the time, whether those political divisions are
Roman provinces or independent Teutonic or Slavonic
kingdoms. But the ecclesiastical divisions, when
once fixed, were more lasting than the temporal
divisions, and many disputes have arisen out of political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
changes which transferred one part of a province or
diocese from one political allegiance to another. Since
the splitting-up of the Western Church, the old ecclesiastical
organization has altogether vanished from some
countries, and has been greatly modified in others, in
Germany most of all.</p>

<p>It seems hardly needful for the understanding of
European history to carry our ecclesiastical survey beyond
the limits of the Latin Church. One of the
Polish provinces, that of Leopol, has carried us to the
borderland of the Eastern and Western Churches, and,
if we pass southwards into the Magyar and South-Slavonic
lands, we find ourselves still more distinctly
on an ecclesiastical march.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hungary.<br />
Strigonium.<br />
Kolocza.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Kingdom of Hungary
formed two Latin provinces, those of <i>Strigonium</i> or
Gran, and of <i>Kolocza</i>; the latter has a very fluctuating
boundary to the south.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dalmatia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Dalmatian coast, the
borderland of all powers and of all religions, formed
three Latin provinces.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Zara.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Jadera</i> or <i>Zara</i>, on her peninsula,
was the head of a small province chiefly made
up of islands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spalato.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another metropolitan had his throne in
the very mausoleum of Diocletian, and the province of
<i>Spalato</i> stretched some way inland over the lands which
have so often changed masters.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ragusa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the south, the see
of <i>Ragusa</i>, the furthest outpost of Latin Christendom
properly so called, had, besides its own coasts and
islands, an indefinite frontier inland. This marks the
furthest extent to which it is needful to trace our
ecclesiastical map. It is the furthest point at which
Latin Christianity can be said to be in any sense at home.
The ecclesiastical organization of the crusading and
Venetian conquests further to the south and east have
but little bearing on historical geography. But, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
the bounds of Latin Christendom, the ecclesiastical
divisions both of the provinces and dioceses within the
older Empire and what we may call the missionary
provinces beyond it, are of the highest importance, and
they should always be kept in mind alongside of the
political geography.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE IMPERIAL KINGDOMS.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Kingdom
of the
<i>East-Franks</i>
or
of <i>Germany</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> division of 887 parted off from the general mass
of the Frankish dominions a distinct <i>Kingdom of the
East-Franks</i>, the acknowledged head of the Frankish
kingdoms, which, as being distinguished from its fellows
as the <i>Regnum Teutonicum</i>, may be best spoken of as a
<i>Kingdom of Germany</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Merging of
the Kingdom
in the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the lasting acquisition of
the Italian and Imperial crowns by the German kings,
and their later acquisition of the kingdom of Burgundy,
gradually tended to obscure the notion of a distinct
German kingdom. The idea of the Kingdom was
merged in the idea of the Empire of which it formed
a part. Later events too tended in the same direction.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Emperors
lose
Italy and
Burgundy,
but keep
Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Italian kingdom gradually fell off from any practical
allegiance to its nominal king the Emperor. So did
the greater part of the Burgundian kingdom. Meanwhile,
though the powers of the Emperors as German
kings were constantly lessening, their authority was
never wholly thrown off till the present century. The
Emperors in short lost their kingdoms of Italy and
Burgundy, and kept their kingdom of Germany. In
the fifteenth century the coronation of the Emperor at
Rome had become a mere ceremony, carrying with it
no real authority in Italy. In the sixteenth century
the ceremony itself went out of use.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Charles the
Fourth
crowned at
Arles, 1365.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Burgundian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
coronation at Arles became irregular at a very early
time, and it is last heard of in the fourteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1792.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the election of the German kings at Frankfurt,
their coronation, in earlier times at Aachen, afterwards
at Frankfurt,
went on regularly till the last years of the
eighteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Endurance
of the German
Diet.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
So, while the national assemblies
of Italy and Burgundy can hardly be said to have been
regularly held at all, while they went altogether out of
use at an early time, the national assembly of Germany,
in one shape or another, never ceased as long as there
was any one calling himself Emperor or German King.
The tendency in all three kingdoms was to split up
into separate principalities and commonwealths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
of Germany,
Italy, and
Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
in Germany the principalities and commonwealths
always kept up some show of connexion with one
another, some show of allegiance to their Imperial
head. In Italy and Burgundy they parted off altogether.
Some became absolutely independent; were
incorporated with other kingdoms or became their
distant dependencies; some were even held by the
Emperors themselves in some other character, and not
by virtue either of their Empire or of their local kingship.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Empire
identified
with
Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus, as the Empire became more and more
nearly coextensive with the German Kingdom, the
distinction between the two was gradually forgotten.
The small parts of the other kingdoms which kept any
trace of their Imperial allegiance came to be looked on
as parts of Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Empire
becomes a
Confederation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In short, the Western Empire
became a German kingdom; or rather it became a
German Confederation with a royal head, a confederation
which still kept up the forms and titles of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1530.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As no German king received an Imperial coronation
after Charles the Fifth, it might in strictness be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
that the Empire came to an end at his abdication.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1556.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And in truth from that date the Empire practically became
a purely German power. But, as the Imperial
forms and titles still went on, the Western Empire
must be looked on as surviving, in the form of a
German kingdom or confederation, down to its final
fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The German
Kingdom
represents
the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Kingdom of Germany then may be looked on
as representing the Western Empire, as being what
was left of the Western Empire after the other parts of
it had fallen away. But the German kingdom itself
underwent, though in a smaller degree, the same fate
as the other two Imperial kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Separation
of parts of
the Kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
While all Italy
and all Burgundy, with some very trifling exceptions,
fell away from the Empire, the mass of Germany
remained Imperial. Still large parts of Germany
were lost to the Empire no less than Italy and Burgundy.
A considerable territory on the western and
south-western frontier of Germany gradually fell away.
Part of this territory has grown into independent
states; part has been incorporated with the French
kingdom. The Swiss Confederation has grown up on
lands partly German, partly Burgundian, partly Italian,
but of which the oldest and greatest part belonged to
the German kingdom. The Confederation of the
United Provinces, represented by the modern kingdom
of the Netherlands, lay wholly<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> within the old German
kingdom: so did by far the greater part of the modern
kingdom of Belgium.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Modern
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In our own day the same tendency
has been shewn in south-eastern as well as
south-western Germany; several members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
ancient kingdom have fallen away to form part of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extension
of Germany
to the
north-east.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But on the northern
and north-eastern frontier the tendency to extension,
with some fluctuations, has gone on from the beginning
of the kingdom to our own day.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geographical
contrast
of the
earlier and
later Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This tendency to lose
territory to the west and south, and to gain territory to
the east and north, had the effect of gradually cutting
off the Western Empire, as represented by the German
kingdom, from any close geographical connexion
with the earlier Empire of which it was the historical
continuation. The Holy Roman Empire, at
the time of its final fall, contained but little territory
which had formed part of the Empire of Trajan. It
contained nothing which had formed part of the Empire
of Justinian, save some small scraps of territory in the
north-eastern corner of the old Italian kingdom.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>The Kingdom of Germany.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Change in
the geography
and
nomenclature
of Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">In tracing out, for our present purpose, the geographical
revolutions of Germany, it will be enough to
look at them, as far as may be, mainly in their European
aspect. Owing to the gradual way in which the
various members of the Empire grew into practical
sovereignty—owing to the constant division of principalities
among many members of the same family—no
country has undergone so many internal geographical
changes as Germany has. In few countries also has
the nomenclature shifted in a more singular way.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ancient
and modern
Saxony and
Bavaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To
take two obvious examples, the modern kingdom of
<i>Saxony</i> has nothing but its name in common with the
Saxony which was brought under the Frankish dominion
by Charles the Great. The modern kingdom
of <i>Bavaria</i> has a considerable territory in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
with the ancient Bavaria; but it has gained so much
at one end and lost so much at the other that the two
cannot be said to be in any practical sense the same
country.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Uses of the
name
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The name of <i>Austria</i> has shifted from the
eastern part of the old <i>Francia</i> to the German mark
against the Magyar, and it has lately wandered altogether
beyond the modern German frontier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
name of <i>Burgundy</i> has borne endless meanings, both
within the Empire and beyond it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prussia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, the ruling
state of modern Germany, a state stretching across
the whole land from east to west, strangely bears
the name of the conquered and extinct <i>Prussian</i>
race. Many of these changes affect the history of Europe
as well as the history of Germany; but many
of the endless changes among the smaller members
of the Empire are matters of purely local interest,
which belong to the historical geography of Germany
only, and which claim no place in the historical geography
of Europe. I shall endeavour therefore in the
present section, first to trace carefully the shiftings of
the German frontier as regards other powers, and
then to bring out such, and such only, of the internal
changes as have a bearing on the general history of
Europe.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The extent of the German kingdom as it stood
after the division of 887 has been roughly traced
already.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Boundaries
under the
Ottos, 936-1002.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It will now be well to go over its frontiers
somewhat more minutely, as they stood at the time of
final separation between the Empire and the West-Frankish
kingdom, the time of final union between the
Empire and the East-Frankish kingdom. This marks the
great age of the Saxon Ottos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Boundary
towards the
West.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The frontier towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
Western kingdom was now fairly ascertained, and
it was subject to dispute only at a few points.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lotharingia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It
is hardly needful to insist again on the fact that all
Lotharingia, in the sense of those days, taking in
all the southern Netherlands except the French fief
of Flanders, was now Imperial.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Encroachments
of
France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is along this
line that the German border has in later times most
largely fallen back. The advance of France has
touched Burgundy more than Germany; but it has,
first swallowed up, and afterwards partly restored,
a considerable part of the German kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Netherlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Netherlands had been practically so cut off from Germany
before the annexations of France in that quarter
began, that they will be better spoken of in another
section.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lorraine
and Elsass.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The other points at which the frontier
has fluctuated on a great scale have been the border
land of <i>Lorraine</i>—as distinguished from the Lower
<i>Lotharingia</i> which has more to do with the history
of the Netherlands—and the Swabian land of
<i>Elsass</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations
of Bar.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Duchy of <i>Bar</i>, the borderland of the
borderland, fluctuated more than once.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1473.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After its
union with the Duchy of Lorraine, it followed the
fortunes of that state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Three
Bishoprics,
1552.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the next century came
the annexation of the three Lotharingian bishoprics
of <i>Metz</i>, <i>Toul</i>, and <i>Verdun</i>, which gave France three
outlying possessions within the geographical borders
of the Lotharingian duchy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Austrian
Elsass,
1648.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the next century,
as the result of the Thirty Years’ War, France obtained
by the Peace of Westfalia the formal cession of
these conquests, and also the great advance of her
frontier by the dismemberment of <i>Elsass</i>. The cession
now made did not take in the whole of Elsass, but only
the possessions and rights of the House of Austria in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
that country. This cession still left both Strassburg
and various smaller towns and districts to the Empire;
but it naturally opened the way to further French
advances in a land where the frontier was so complicated
and where difficulties were so easily raised as to
treaty-rights.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gradual annexation
of
Elsass,
1679-1789.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A series of annexations, <i>réunions</i> as they
were called, gradually united nearly all Elsass to France.

In the next century it was separated from
the Empire to become the life-possession of the Polish
king Stanislaus, and on his death it was finally added
to France just before a far greater series of French
annexations began.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of the
left bank of
the Rhine,
1801.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The wars of the French Revolution,
confirmed by the Peace of <i>Luneville</i>, tore away from
Germany and the Empire all that lay on the left bank
of the Rhine. In other words, the Western <i>Francia</i>,
the duchy of the lords of Paris, advanced itself to the
utmost limits of the Gaul of Cæsar. This was the last
annexation of France at the expense of the old German
kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dissolution
of the
Kingdom
and Empire,
1806.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was indeed the main cause of the formal
dissolution of the kingdom which happened a few years
later. The utter transformation of Germany within and
without which now followed must be spoken of at a
later stage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Frontier of
Germany
and Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The frontier of Germany and Burgundy, while they
still remained distinct kingdoms, fluctuated a good
deal, especially in the lands which now form Switzerland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
Burgundy
with the
Empire,
1033.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But this frontier ceased to be of any practical
importance when the Burgundian kingdom was united
with the Empire. The later history of Burgundy, consisting
of the gradual incorporation by France of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
greater part of the kingdom, and the growth of the
remnant into the western cantons of the Swiss Confederation,
will be told elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Frontier of
Germany
and Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">Towards Italy again the frontier was sometimes
doubtful. <i>Chiavenna</i>, for instance, sometimes appears
in the tenth and eleventh centuries as German; so do
the greater districts of <i>Trent</i>, <i>Aquileia</i>, <i>Istria</i>, and even
<i>Verona</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Marchland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All these formed a marchland, part of which
in the end became definitely attached to Germany and
part to Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
the Crowns,
961-1530.<br />
961-1250.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But here again, as long as the German
and Italian crowns were united, and as long as their
common king kept any real authority in either kingdom,
the frontier was of no great practical importance.
So in later times, both before and after the dissolution
of the German Kingdom, the question has practically
been a question between Italy and the House of Austria
rather than between Italy and Germany as such. These
changes also will better come in another section.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eastern and
Northern
frontiers.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The case is quite different with regard to the
eastern and northern frontiers, on which the really
greatest changes took place, and where Germany, as
Germany, made its greatest advances.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance
of the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Along this line
the Roman Empire and the German Kingdom meant the
same thing. On this side the frontier had to be marked,
so far as it could be marked, against nations which
had had nothing to do with the elder Empire. Here
then for many ages the Roman Terminus advanced and
fell back according to the accidents of a long warfare.</p>

<p>The whole frontier of the kingdom towards its
northern and eastern neighbours was defended by a
series of <i>marks</i> or border territories whose rulers were
clothed with special powers for the defence and extension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
of the frontier.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They had to guard the realm
against the Dane in the north, and against the Slave
during the whole remaining length of the eastern frontier,
except where, in the last years of the ninth century,
the Magyar thrust himself in between the northern and
southern Slaves.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hungarian
frontier.<br />
Mark of
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Here the frontier, as against Hungary
and Croatia, was defended by the marks of <i>Krain</i> or
<i>Carniola</i>, <i>Kärnthen</i> or <i>Carinthia</i>,
<i>Austrian</i> mark to the north of them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Little
change on
this
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This frontier
has changed least of all. It may, without any great
breach of accuracy, be said to have remained the
same from the days of the Saxon Emperors till now.
The part where it was at all fluctuating was along the
Austrian mark, rather than along the two marks to
the south of it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Occasional
homage of
Hungary to
the Emperors.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Emperors claimed, and sometimes
enforced, a feudal superiority over the Hungarian
kings. But this kind of precarious submission does
not affect geography. Hungary always remained a
separate kingdom; the Imperial supremacy was something
purely external, and it was always thrown off
on the first opportunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Frontier
towards
Denmark.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The same may be said of <i>Denmark</i>. For a short
time a German mark was formed north of the Eider.

But, when the Danish kingdom had grown into the
Northern Empire of Cnut, the German frontier fell back
here also, and the <i>Eider</i> remained the boundary of the
Empire till its fall.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Occasional
homage of
the Danish
Kings.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As with Hungary, so with Denmark;
more than one Danish king became the man of
Cæsar; but here again the precarious acknowledgement
of Imperial supremacy had no effect on geography.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slavonic
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It is in the intermediate lands, along the vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
frontier where the Empire marched on the northern
<i>Slavonic</i> lands, that the real historical geography of
Germany lies for some ages.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuation
of territory.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Here the boundary was
ever fluctuating.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Slaves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the time of the division of 887,
the Slaves held all east of the Elbe and a good deal
to the west. How far they had during the Wandering
of the Nations stepped into the place of earlier Teutonic
inhabitants is a question which belongs to another
field of inquiry. We must here start from the geographical
fact that, at the time when the modern states
of Europe began to form themselves, the Slaves were
actually in possession of the great North-Eastern region
of modern Germany. Their special mention will come in
their special place; we must here mark that modern
Germany has largely formed itself by the gradual conquest
and colonization of lands which at the end of the
ninth century were Slavonic. The German kingdom
spread itself far to the North-East, and German settlements
and German influences spread themselves far beyond
the formal bounds of the German kingdom. Three
special instruments worked together in bringing about
this end. The Saxon Dukes came first. In after times
came the great league of German cities, the famous
<i>Hansa</i> which, like some other bodies originally commercial,
became a political power, and which spread German
influences over the whole of the shores of the Baltic.
Along with them, from the thirteenth century onwards,
worked the great military order of the Teutonic knights.
Out of their conquests came the first beginnings of the
Prussian state, and the extension of German rule and
the German speech over much which in modern geography
has become Russian. In a history of the German
nation all these causes would have to be dealt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
with together as joint instruments towards the same
end. In a purely geographical view the case is different.
Some of these influences concern the formation of the
actual German kingdom; others have geographically
more to do with the group of powers more to the north-east,
the Slavonic states of Poland and Russia, and their
Lithuanian and Finnish neighbours. The growth and
fall of the military orders will therefore most naturally
come in another section. We have here to trace
out those changes only which helped to give the German
kingdom the definite geographical extent which it
held for some centuries before its final fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Saxon

<p>Beginning at the north, in the lands where German,
Slave, and Dane came into close contact, in <i>Saxony

the western coast, and the narrow <i>Saxon mark</i> fenced
off the German land.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mark of
the Billungs,
960-1106.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Saxon dukes of the house
of Billung formed a German mark, which took in the
lands reaching from the Elbe to the strait which divides
the isle of Rügen from the mainland. But this possession
was altogether precarious.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its fluctuations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It again became a Slavonic
kingdom; then it was a possession of Denmark;
it cannot be looked on as definitely becoming part
of the German realm till the thirteenth century.

The
chief state in these lands which has lasted till later
times is the duchy of <i>Mecklenburg</i>, the rulers of which,
in its two modern divisions, are the only modern princes
who directly represent an old Slavonic royal house.
Meanwhile a way was opened for a vast extension of
German influence through the whole North, by the
growth of the city of <i>Lübeck</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Foundation

merchant League.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Hanse

To the south of these lands come
those Slavonic lands which have grown into the modern
kingdom of Saxony and the central parts of the
modern kingdom of Prussia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marchlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

down to our own day.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Brandenburg.<br />

Meissen.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The mark of <i>Brandenburg</i> in
its various divisions,
the mark of <i>Lausitz</i> or <i>Lusatia</i>,
where a Slavonic remnant still lingers,
and the mark of <i>Meissen</i>, long preserved the memory of the times
when these lands, which afterwards came to play so
great a part in the internal history of Germany, were
still outlying and precarious possessions of the German
realm.</p>

<p class="pb2">To the south-east lay the <i>Bohemian</i> lands, whose
history has been somewhat different.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bohemia a
fief, 928.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The duchy, afterwards
kingdom, of <i>Bohemia</i>, became, early in the tenth

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Becomes a

From that time
ever afterwards, save during one moment of passing
Polish annexation, it remained one of its principal members,
ruled, as long as the Empire lasted, by princes
holding electoral rank. The boundaries of the kingdom
itself have hardly varied at all.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Moravia.<br />
1019.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dependent marchland
of <i>Moravia</i> to the east, the remnant of the great
Moravian kingdom whose history will come more fittingly
in another chapter, fluctuated for a long while
between Hungarian, Polish, and Bohemian supremacy.
But from the early part of the eleventh century it
remained under Bohemian rule, and therefore under
Imperial superiority.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>More distant
Slavonic
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the east of this nearer zone
of Slavonic dependencies, lay another range of Slavonic
states, some of which were gradually incorporated
with the German kingdom, while others remained
distinct down to modern times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pomerania.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Pomerania</i> on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
Baltic coast is a name which has often changed both
its geographical extent and its political allegiance.
The eastern part of the land now so called lay
open, as will be hereafter seen, to the occupation of
the Pole, and its western part to that of the Dane.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Native
princes
go on.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But in the end it took its place on the map in
the form of two duchies, ruled, like Mecklenburg, by
native princes under Imperial supremacy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Polish
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
South of
Pomerania, the German march bordered on the growing
power of <i>Poland</i>, and between Poland and Hungary
lay the northern <i>Croatia</i> or <i>Chrobatia</i>. The
German supremacy seems sometimes to have been
extended as far as the Wartha, and, in the Chrobatian
land, even beyond the Vistula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Occasional
homage of
the Polish
kings.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But this occupation was
quite momentary; Poland grew up, like Hungary, as
a kingdom, some of whose dukes and kings admitted
the Imperial supremacy, but which gradually became
wholly independent.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Silesia
Polish, 999.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The border province of <i>Silesia</i>,

became definitely Polish at the end of the tenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bohemian,

Afterwards it was divided into several principalities,
whose dukes passed under Bohemian vassalage,
and so became members of the Empire. Thus in the
course of some ages, a boundary was drawn between
Germany and Poland which lasted down to modern
times.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extension
of the Empire
to the
east.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">The result of this survey is to show how great, and
at the same time how gradual, was the extension of
the German power eastward. A Roman Empire with
a long Baltic coast was something that had never been
dreamed of in earlier days.
If the extension of the
German name was but the recovery of long lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
Teutonic lands, the extension to them of the Imperial
name which had become identified with Germany
was at least wholly new.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Slavonic
lands
Germanized.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In all the lands
now annexed, save in a few exceptional districts,
German annexation meant German colonization, and
the assimilation of the surviving inhabitants to the
speech and manners of Germany. Colonists were
brought, specially from the Frisian lands, by whose
means the Low-Dutch tongue was spread along the
whole southern coast of the Baltic. German cities were
founded. The marchlands grew into powerful German
states. At last one of these marchlands, united with
a German conquest still further cut off from the heart
of the old German realm, has grown into a state which
in our own days has become the Imperial power of
Germany.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Internal
geography
of Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The internal geography of the German kingdom is
the greatest difficulty of such a work as the present. To
trace the boundaries of the kingdom as against other
kingdoms is comparatively easy; but to trace out the
endless shiftings, the unions and the divisions, of the
countless small principalities and commonwealths which
arose within the kingdom, would be a hopeless attempt.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
the principalities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Still the growth of the dukes, counts, and other princes
of Germany into independent sovereigns is the great
feature of German history, as the consequent wiping
out of old divisions, and shifting to and fro of old names,
is the special feature of German historical geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes in
nomenclature.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dying out of the old names has a historical
interest, and the growth of the new powers which
have supplanted them has both an historical and a
political interest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
Prussia and
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is specially important to mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
how the two powers which have stood at the head of
Germany in modern times in no way represent any of
the old divisions of the German name. They have
grown out of the outlying <i>marks</i> planted against the
Slave and the Magyar. The mark of <i>Brandenburg</i>, the
mark against the Slave, has grown into the kingdom of
<i>Prussia</i>, the Imperial state of Germany in its latest
form. The <i>Eastern</i> mark, the mark against the Magyar,
has grown into the archduchy which gave Germany so
many kings, into the so-called Austrian ‘empire,’ into
the Austro-Hungarian monarchy of our own day.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Analogies
between
Brandenburg
and
other
marchlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
growth of Brandenburg or Prussia again affords an
instructive comparison with the growth of Wessex in
England, of France in Gaul, and of Castile in Spain.
In all these cases alike, it has been a marchland
which has come to the front and has become the head
of the united nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The great
Duchies
under the
Saxon and
Frankish
Kings, 919-1125.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">Starting from the division of 887, we shall find
several important landmarks in the history of the
German kingdom which may help us in this most
difficult part of our work. Under the Saxon and
Frankish kings we see the great duchies still forming
the main divisions, while the kingdom is enlarged by
Slavonic conquests to the east and by the definite adhesion
of Lotharingia to the west.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Decline of
the Duchies
under the
Swabian
Kings,
1137-1254.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Under the Swabian
kings we see the break-up of the great duchies. In
the partition of Saxony the process which was everywhere
silently and gradually at work was formally
carried out in the greatest case of all by Imperial,
and national authority.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>End of the
<i>Gauverfassung</i>.<br />
Growth of
territorial
Principalities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>Gauverfassung</i>, the immemorial
system of Teutonic communities, now finally
changes into a system of territorial principalities, broken
only by the many free cities and the few free districts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
which owned no lord but the King.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
the march
powers.
1254-1512.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
During this period
too we see the beginnings of some of the powers which
became chief at a later day, the powers of the eastern
marchland, <i>Brandenburg</i>, <i>Austria</i>, <i>Saxony</i> in the later
sense. The time from the so-called <i>Interregnum</i> to the
legislation under Maximilian is marked by the further
growth of these powers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
the House
of Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is further marked by the
beginning of that connexion of the Austrian duchy, and
of the Imperial crown itself, with lands beyond the
bounds of the Kingdom and the Empire which led in
the end to the special and anomalous position of the
House of Austria as an European power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Separation
of Switzerland,
1495-1648.<br />
Of the Netherlands,
1430-1648.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
During the
same period comes the practical separation of <i>Switzerland</i>
and the <i>Netherlands</i> from the German kingdom.
In short it was during this age that Germany in its later
aspect was formed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Legislation
under Maximilian,
1495-1512.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The legislation of Maximilian’s reign,
the attempts then made to bring the kingdom to a greater
degree of unity, have left their mark on geography
in the division of Germany into <i>circles</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division
into circles,
1500-1512.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This division,
though it was not perfectly complete, though it did not
extend to every corner of the kingdom, was strictly an
administrative division of the kingdom itself as such;
but the mapping out of the circles, the difference of which
in point of size is remarkable, was itself affected by the
geographical extent of the dominions of the princes who
held lands within them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thirty
Years’ War,
1618-1648.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The seventeenth century is
marked by the results of the Thirty Years’ War and of
other changes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Powers
holding
lands within
and without
Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its most important geographical result
was to carry on the process which had begun with the
Austrian House, the formation of powers holding lands
both within and without the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austria.<br />
Sweden.<br />
Union of
Brandenburg
and
Prussia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus, beside
the union of the Hungarian kingdom with the Austrian
archduchy, the King of Sweden now held lands as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
prince of the Empire, and the same result was brought
about in another way by the union of the Electorate of
Brandenburg with the Duchy of Prussia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rivalry of
Prussia and
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This, and
other accessions of territory, now made Brandenburg
as distinctly the first power of northern Germany as
Austria was of southern Germany, and in the eighteenth
century the rivalry of these two powers becomes the
chief centre, not only of German but of European politics.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hannover
and Great
Britain,
1715.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The union of the Electorate of Hannover under the
same sovereign with the kingdom of Great Britain
further increased the number of princes ruling both
within Germany and without it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dissolution
of the Kingdom,
1806.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, the wars of
the latter years of the eighteenth and the beginning of
the nineteenth century led to the dissolution alike of
the German kingdom and of the Roman Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The German
Confederation,
1815-1866.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then, after a time of confusion and foreign occupation,
comes the formation of a Confederation with boundaries
nearly the same as the later boundaries of the kingdom.
But the Confederation now appears as something quite
subordinate to its two leading members.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austria and
Prussia
greater
than the
Confederation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Germany, as
such, no longer counts as a great European power,
but Prussia and Austria, the two chief holders at
once of German and of non-German lands, stand forth
among the chief bearers of European rank.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The new
Confederation
and
Empire,
1866-1870.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, the
changes of our own day have given us an Imperial
Germany with geographical boundaries altogether new,
a Germany from which the south-eastern German lands
are cut off, while the Polish and other non-German
possessions of Prussia to the north-east have become
an integral part of the new Empire. The task of the
geographer is thereby greatly simplified. Down to the
last changes, one of his greatest difficulties is to make
his map show with any clearness what was the extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
of the German Kingdom or Confederation, and at the
same time what was the extent of the dominions of
those princes who held lands both in Germany and out
of it. By the last arrangements this difficulty at least
is altogether taken away.</p>

their predominance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The great

The kingdom is still made up of

It is perhaps for this very reason that, of the four
duchies which preserve the names of the four great
divisions of the German nation, the Eastern Francia is
the one which has most utterly vanished from the
modern map and from modern memory. Another
cause may have strengthened its tendency to vanish.
The policy of the kings forbade that the Frankish duchy
should become the abiding heritage of any princely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
family.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its ecclesiastical
Dukes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The ducal title of the Eastern Francia was at
two periods of its history borne by ecclesiastical princes
in the persons of the Bishops of <i>Würzburg</i>; but it never
gave its name, like Saxony and Bavaria, to any ruling
house.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Analogy
with
Wessex.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The English student will notice the analogy
by which, among all the ancient English kingdoms,
Wessex, the cradle of the English monarchy, is the one
whose name has most utterly vanished from modern
memory.</p>

<p class="pb2">The only way to grasp the endless shiftings and
divisions of the German principalities, so as to give
anything like a clear general view, will be to take the
great duchies, and to point out in a general way the
steps by which they split asunder, and the chief states
of any historical importance which rose out of their
divisions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
new powers
in the
twelfth
century.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Most of these new powers begin to be of
importance in the twelfth century, a time which is
specially marked as the æra when those two states
which have had most to do with the making or unmaking
of modern Germany begin to find their place
in history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Brandenburg
and
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is then that the two great marchlands
of Brandenburg and Austria begin to take their place
among the leading powers of the German kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Circles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, in making this survey, it will be well to bear in
mind the much later division into circles. The circles,
an attempt to create administrative divisions of the
kingdom as such, were, in a faint way, a return to the
ancient duchies, the names of which were to some
extent retained. Thus we have the two <i>Saxon</i> circles,
<i>Upper</i> and <i>Lower</i>, and the three of <i>Franconia</i>, <i>Swabia</i>,
and <i>Bavaria</i>. All of these keep up the names of
ancient duchies, and most of them keep up a stronger
or fainter geographical connexion with the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
lands whose names they bore. The other circles, the
two <i>Rhenish</i> circles, <i>Upper</i> and <i>Lower</i>, and those of
<i>Westfalia</i>, <i>Austria</i>, and <i>Burgundy</i>—the last name being
used in a sense altogether new—arose out of changes
which took place between the twelfth and fifteenth
centuries, some of which we shall have to notice.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saxony; its

<p>First then, the great duchy of <i>Saxony</i> consisted of
three main divisions, <i>Westfalia</i>, <i>Engern</i> or <i>Angria</i>,
and <i>Eastfalia</i>. <i>Thuringia</i> to the south-east, and the
<i>Frisian</i> lands to the north-west, may be looked on as
in some sort appendages to the Saxon duchy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of

The

the Wends on this side were all looked on as additions
made to the Saxon territory.

Westfalia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The archiepiscopal Electors of <i>Köln</i> received the title of
Dukes of <i>Westfalia</i> and <i>Engern</i>. But in the greater part
of those districts the grant remained merely nominal,
though the ducal title, with a small actual Westfalian
duchy, remained to the electorate till the end. From
these lands the Saxon name may be looked on as
having altogether passed away.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New use of
the name

The name of <i>Saxony</i>,

remnant of the old duchy, and to Thuringia and the
Slavonic conquests to the east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Saxon
Circles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the later division
of Germany these lands formed the two circles of <i>Upper</i>
and <i>Lower Saxony</i>; and it was within their limits that
the various states arose which have kept on the Saxon
name to our own time.</p>

<p>From the descendants of Henry the Lion himself,
and from the allodial lands which they kept, the Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
name passed away, except so far as they became part
of the Lower-Saxon circle.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Brunswick.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They held their place as
princes of the Empire, no longer as Dukes of Saxony,
but as Dukes of <i>Brunswick</i>, a house which gave Rome
one Emperor and England a dynasty of kings.

After
some of the usual divisions, two Brunswick principalities
finally took their place on the map, those of <i>Lüneburg</i>
and <i>Wolfenbüttel</i>, the latter having the town of
Brunswick for its capital. The Lüneburg duchy grew.

electoral rank, and early in the next century it was
finally enlarged by the acquisition of the bishoprics
of <i>Bremen</i> and <i>Verden</i>.

of the other line.</p>

<p class="pb2">The Saxon name itself withdrew in the end from
the old Saxony to the lands conquered from the Slave.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bernhard

On the fall of Henry the Lion, the duchy of Saxony,
cut short by the grant to the archbishops of Köln, was
granted to Bernhard of Ballensted, the founder of the
Ascanian House.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sachsen-Lauenburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of the older Saxon land his house
kept only for a while the small district north of the

which in the end became part of the Hannover electorate.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1423.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it was in Thuringia and the conquered
Slavonic lands to the east of Thuringia that a new
Saxony arose, which kept on somewhat of the European
position of the Saxon name down to modern times.
This new Saxony, with Wittenberg for its capital,
grew, through the addition of <i>Thuringia</i> and <i>Meissen</i>,
into the Saxon Electorate which played so great a
part during the three last centuries of the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
of the German kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Divisions
and unions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But in Saxony too the
usual divisions took place. Lauenburg parted off; so
did the smaller duchies which still keep the Saxon name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1547.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The ducal and electoral dignities were divided, till
the two, united under the famous Maurice, formed the
Saxon electorate as it stood at the dissolution of the
kingdom. It was in short a new state, one which had
succeeded to the name, but which could in no other
way be thought to represent, the Saxony whose conquest
cost so many campaigns to Charles the Great.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Mark
of Brandenburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Another power which arose in the marchland of
Saxon and Slave, to the north of Saxony in the later
sense, was the land known specially as the <i>Mark</i>, the
groundwork of the power which has in our own day
risen to the head of Germany. The <i>North Mark</i> of
Saxony became the <i>Mark of Brandenburg</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reign of
Albert the
Bear, 1134-1170.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, under Albert the Bear

expense of the Slaves.

Bohemia,
1373-1415.<br />
House of
Hohenzollern,

United for a time with the
kingdom of Bohemia, it passed into the house of the
Burgraves of <i>Nürnberg</i>, that House of Hohenzollern
which has grown step by step till it has reached Imperial
rank in our own day. The power thus formed
presently acquired a special character by the acquisition
of what may be called a German land out of
Germany, a land which gave them in the end a
higher title, and which by its geographical position led
irresistibly to a further increase of territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
Brandenburg
and
Prussia,
1611-1618.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Early in
the seventeenth century the Electors of Brandenburg
acquired by inheritance the <i>Duchy of Prussia</i>, that is
merely Eastern Prussia, a fief, not of the Empire but of
the crown of Poland, and which lay geographically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
apart from their strictly German dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prussia independent
of Poland,

The common
sovereign of Brandenburg and Prussia was thus
the man of two lords; but the Great Elector Frederick
William became a wholly independent sovereign in his
duchy, and his son Frederick took on himself the kingly
title for the land which was thus freed from all homage.
Both before and after the union with Prussia, the Electors
of Brandenburg continued largely to increase their German
dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1523-1623.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A temporary possession of the principality
of <i>Jägerndorf</i> in Silesia, unimportant in itself, led
to great events in later times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Westfalian
possessions
of Brandenburg,
1614-1666.<br />
1702-1744.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The acquisition, at various
times in the seventeenth century, of <i>Cleve</i> and other
outlying Westfalian lands, which were further increased
in the next century, led in the same way to the modern
dominion of Prussia in western Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisitions

Pomerania,

1713-1719.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the most
solid acquisition of Brandenburg in this age was that of
<i>Eastern Pomerania</i>, to which the town of Stettin, with
a further increase of territory, was added after the wars
of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. The events of the
Thirty Years’ War also increased the dominions both of
Brandenburg and Saxony at the expense of the neighbouring
ecclesiastical princes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Later acquisitions
of
Prussia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The later acquisitions of
the House of Hohenzollern, after the Electors of Brandenburg
had taken the kingly title from their Prussian
duchy, concern Prussia as an European power at least as
much as they concern Brandenburg as a German power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German
character of
the Prussian
Monarchy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Yet their proper place comes in the history of Germany.
Unlike the other princes who held lands within and
without the German kingdom, the Kings of Prussia
and Electors of Brandenburg have remained essentially
German princes. Their acquisitions of territory out of
Germany have all been in fact enlargements, if not of
the soil of Germany, at least of the sphere of German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
influence. And, at last, in marked contrast to the fate
of the rival House of Austria, the whole Prussian dominions
have been incorporated with the new German
Empire, and form the immediate dominion of its Imperial
head.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spread of
the name of
<i>Prussia</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The outward sign of this change, the
outward sign of the special position of Brandenburg, as
compared with Holstein or Austria, is the strange
spread of the name of <i>Prussia</i> over the German dominions
of the King of Prussia. No such spread has
taken place with the name of Denmark or of Hungary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
Silesia,
1741.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Within Germany the greatest enlargement of the
dominion of Prussia—as we may now begin to call it
instead of Brandenburg—was the acquisition of by far
the greater part of <i>Schlesien</i> or <i>Silesia</i>, hitherto part of
the Bohemian lands, and then held by the House of
Austria. This, it should be noted, was an acquisition
which could hardly fail to lead to further acquisitions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geographical
character
of the
Prussian
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The geographical characteristic of the Prussian dominions
was the way in which they lay in detached
pieces, and the enormous extent of frontier as compared
with the area of the country. The kingdom
itself lay detached, hemmed in and intersected by the
territory of Poland. The electorate, with the Pomeranian
territory, formed a somewhat more compact
mass; but even this had a very large frontier compared
with its area. The Westfalian possessions, the
district of <i>Cottbus</i>, and other outlying dominions, lay
quite apart. The addition of Silesia increased this characteristic
yet further.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
Silesia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The newly won duchy, barely
joining the electorate, ran out as a kind of peninsula
between Saxony, Bohemia, and Poland. Silesia, first as
a Polish and then as a Bohemian fief, had formed
part of a fairly compact geographical mass; as part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
the same dominion with Prussia and Brandenburg, it
was an all but isolated land with an enormous frontier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisitions
from
Poland,
1772-1795.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The details of the Polish acquisitions of Prussia will be
best given in our survey of Poland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their geographical
character.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it should be
noted that each of the portions of territory which were
added to Prussia by the several partitions has a geographical
character of its own.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1772.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The addition of <i>West-Prussia</i>—that
is the geographical union of the kingdom
and the electorate—was something which could not
fail in the nature of things to come sooner or later.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1793.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The second addition of <i>South-Prussia</i> might seem geographically
needed in order to leave Silesia no longer
peninsular.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1795.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The last, and most short-lived addition of
<i>New-East-Prussia</i> had no such geographical necessity
as the other two. Still it helped to give greater compactness
to the kingdom, and to lessen its frontier in
comparison with its area.</p>

<p class="pb2">Another acquisition of the House of Hohenzollern
during the eighteenth century, though temporary, deserves
a passing notice.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>East-Friesland,
1744.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among its Westfalian annexations
was <i>East-Friesland</i>. The King of Prussia thus
became, during the last half of the eighteenth century,
an oceanic potentate, a character which he presently
lost, and which, save for a moment in the days of confusion,
he obtained again only in our own day.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Parts of
Saxony held

kings.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A large part of Saxony, both in the older and in the
later sense, thus came to form part of a dominion containing
both German and non-German lands, but in
which the German character was in every way predominant.
Other parts of Saxony in the same extended
sense also came to form part of the dominions
of princes who ruled both in and out of Germany, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
in whom the non-German character was yet more
predominant.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Holstein:<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

modern <i>Holstein</i>, passed into the hands of the Danish
Kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>its relation
to Sleswick.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its shifting relations towards Denmark and
Germany and towards the neighbouring land of <i>Sleswick</i>,
as having become matter of international dispute
between Denmark and Germany, will be best spoken
of when we come to deal with Denmark. The events
of the Thirty Years’ War also made the Swedish
kings for a while considerable potentates in northern
Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German territories
of
Sweden,
1648-1815.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Peace of Westfalia confirmed to them
<i>Western Pomerania</i> and the town of <i>Wismar</i> on the
Baltic, and the bishoprics of <i>Bremen</i> and <i>Verden</i> which
gave them an oceanic coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1720.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But these last lands were,
as we have seen afterwards, ceded to Hannover, and
the Pomeranian possessions of Sweden were also cut
short by cession to Brandenburg. But the possession
of Wismar and a part of Pomerania still gave the
Swedish kings a position as German princes down to
the dissolution of the Empire.</p>

<p class="pb2">These are the chief powers which rose to historical
importance within the bounds of Saxony, in the widest
sense of that word. To trace every division and union
which created or extinguished any of the smaller principalities,
or even to mark every minute change of
frontier among the greater powers, would be impossible.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Free cities
of Saxony.<br />
The Hanse
Towns.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it must be further remembered that the Saxon
circles were the seats of some of the greatest of the free
cities of Germany, the leading members of the Hanseatic
League. In the growth of German commerce the
Rhenish lands took the lead, and, in the earliest days
of the Hansa, <i>Köln</i> held the first place among its cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lübeck,

The pre-eminence afterwards passed to havens nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
to the Ocean and the Baltic, where, among a crowd of
others, the Imperial cities of <i>Lübeck</i> and <i>Bremen</i> stand
out foremost, and with them <i>Hamburg</i>, a rival which
has in later times outstripped them. And at this point
it may be noticed that Lübeck and Bremen specially
illustrate a law which extended to many other of the
episcopal cities of Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The cities
and the
bishoprics.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Bishop became a
prince, and held a greater or smaller extent of territory
in temporal sovereignty. But the city which contained
his see remained independent of him in temporal things,
and knew him only as its spiritual shepherd. Such were
the archbishopric of Bremen and the bishopric of Lübeck,
principalities which, after the change of religion,
passed into secular hands. Thus we have seen the archbishopric
of Bremen pass, first to Sweden, and then to
Hannover. But the two cities always remained independent
commonwealths, owning no superior but the
Emperor.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Franconia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Rhenish
Circles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The western
and northern part of the duchy, together with a good
deal of territory which was strictly Lotharingian, became
part of the two Rhenish circles. Thus <i>Fulda</i>, the
greatest of German abbeys, passed away from the
Frankish name. In north-eastern Francia, the <i>Hessian</i>
principalities grew up to the north-west. Within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Franconian circle lay <i>Würzburg</i>, the see of the bishops
who bore the ducal title, the other great bishopric
of <i>Bamberg</i>, together with the free city of <i>Nürnberg</i>,
and various smaller principalities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ecclesiastical
States
on the
Rhine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the Rhenish
lands, both within and without the old Francia, one
chief characteristic is the predominance of the ecclesiastical
principalities, <i>Mainz</i>, <i>Köln</i>, <i>Worms</i>, <i>Speyer</i>, and
<i>Strassburg</i>. The chief temporal power which arose in
this region was the <i>Palatinate of the Rhine</i>, a power
which, like others, went through many unions and divisions,
and spread into four circles, those of Upper and
Lower Rhine, Westfalia, and Bavaria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bavaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last district,
though united with the Palatine Electorate, was, from
the early part of the fourteenth century, distinguished
from the Palatinate of the Rhine as the <i>Oberpfalz</i> or
<i>Upper Palatinate</i>. To the south of it lay the <i>Bavarian</i>
principalities. These, united into a single duchy, formed
the power which grew into the modern kingdom. But
neither this duchy nor the whole Bavarian circle at all
reached to the extent of the ancient Bavaria which
bordered on Italy.

specially cut short by the encroachments of France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Circle of
Swabia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>Swabian</i> circle answered more nearly than most
of the new divisions to the old Swabian duchy, as that
duchy stood without counting the marchland of Elsass.
No part of Germany was more cut up into small states
than the old land of the Hohenstaufen. A crowd of
principalities, secular and ecclesiastical, among them
the lesser principalities of the Hohenzollern House,
of free cities, and of outlying possessions of the houses
of Austria made up the main part of the circle.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ecclesiastical
towns of
Swabia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Strassburg</i>, <i>Augsburg</i>, <i>Constanz</i>, <i>St. Gallen</i>, <i>Chur</i>, <i>Zürich</i>,
are among the great bishoprics and other ecclesiastical
foundations of the old Swabia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Part of
Swabia becomes
Switzerland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, as I shall
show more fully in another section, large districts in the
south-east, those which formed the <i>Old League of High
Germany</i>, had practically fallen away from the kingdom
before the new division was made, and were therefore
never reckoned in any circle.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Baden.<br />
Württemberg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Two Swabian principalities,
the mark of <i>Baden</i>, and <i>Württemberg</i>, first county
and then duchy, came gradually to the first place in
this region. As such they still remain, preserving in
some sort a divided representation of the old Swabia.</p>


<p class="p2">Two important parts of the old kingdom, two circles
of the division of Maximilian, still remain. These are
the lands which form the circles of <i>Burgundy</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
<i>Austria</i>. These are lands which have, in earlier or
later times, wholly fallen off from the German Kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Circle of
<i>Austria</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>Austrian</i> circle was formed of the lands in
southern Germany which gradually gathered in the
hands of the second Austrian dynasty, the House
of Habsburg.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
the House
of Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Starting from the original mark on the
Hungarian frontier, those lands grew, first into a great
German, and then into a great European, power, and
the latest changes have made even their German lands
politically non-German. The growth of the Austrian
House will therefore be properly dealt with in a separate
section.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
its German
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is enough to say here that the Austrian
dominion in Germany gradually took in, besides the
original duchy, the south-eastern duchies of <i>Steiermark</i>
or <i>Styria</i>, <i>Kärnthen</i> or <i>Carinthia</i>, and <i>Krain</i> or <i>Carniola</i>,
with the Italian borderlands of <i>Görz</i>, <i>Aquileia</i>, and part
of <i>Istria</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tyrol.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Joined to these by a kind of geographical
isthmus, like that which joins Silesia and Brandenburg,
lay the western possessions of the house, the Bavarian
county of <i>Tyrol</i> and various outlying strips and points
of lands in <i>Swabia</i> and <i>Elsass</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Swabian
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The growth of the
Confederates cut short the Swabian possessions of Austria,
as the later cession to France cut short its Alsatian
possessions. Still a Swabian remnant remained down
to the dissolution of the Kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bohemia
and its dependencies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The kingdom of
<i>Bohemia</i>, with the dependent lands of Moravia and <i>Silesia</i>,
though held by the Archdukes of Austria and
giving them electoral rank, was not included in any
German circle.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Trent and
Brixen.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Austrian circle moreover was not
wholly made up of the dominions of the Austrian house;
besides some smaller territories it also took in the
bishoprics of <i>Trent</i> and <i>Brixen</i> on the debateable frontier
of Italy and old Bavaria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Circle of
Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The <i>Burgundian</i> circle was the last and the strangest
use of the Burgundian name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dominion of
the Valois
Dukes
within the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It consisted of those
parts of the dominions of the Dukes of Burgundy of the
House of Valois which remained to their descendants
of the House of Austria at the time of the division into
circles. These did not all lie strictly within the boundaries
of the German kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Imperial
Netherlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Within that kingdom
indeed lay the Northern Netherlands, the Frisian
lands of <i>Holland</i>, <i>Zealand</i>, and <i>West-Friesland</i>, as also
<i>Brabant</i> and other Lotharingian lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the circle
also took in the <i>County of Burgundy or Franche
Comté</i>, part of the old kingdom of Burgundy, and lastly
<i>Flanders</i> and <i>Artois</i>, lands beyond the bounds of the
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Flanders
and Artois
released
from
homage to
France,
1526.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were fiefs of France which were released
from their homage to that crown by the treaty between
Charles the Fifth and Francis the First of France. The
Burgundian circle thus took in all the Imperial fiefs of
the Valois dukes, together with a small part of their
French fiefs. As all, or nearly all, of these lands
altogether fell away from the German kingdom, and as
those parts of them which now form the two kingdoms
of the Low Countries have a certain historical being of
their own, it will be well to keep their more detailed
mention also for a special section.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>The Confederation and Empire of Germany.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Germany
changed
from a
kingdom to
a confederation.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>


<p>Our survey in the last section has carried us down
to the beginning of the changes which led to the break-up
of the old German Kingdom. Germany is the
only land in history which has changed from a
kingdom to a confederation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sketch of
the process,
1806-1815.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The tie which bound
the vassal princes to the king became so lax that it
was at last thrown off altogether. In this process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
foreign invasion largely helped. Between the two processes
of foreign war and domestic disintegration, a
chaotic time followed, in which boundaries were ever
shifting and new states were ever rising and falling.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The German
<i>Bund</i>,
1815.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the end, nearly all the lands which had formed the
old kingdom came together again, with new names and
boundaries, as members of a lax Confederation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The new
Confederation
and
Empire,
1866-1871.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
latest events of all have driven the former chief of the
Confederation beyond its boundaries; they have joined its
other members together by a much closer tie; they have
raised the second member of the former Confederation
to the post of perpetual chief of the new Confederation,
and they have further clothed him with the Imperial
title.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The new
Empire
still federal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it must be remembered that the modern
Empire of Germany is still a Federal state. Its chief
bears the title of Emperor; still the relation is federal
and not feudal. The lesser members of the Empire
are not vassals of the Emperor, as they were in the days
of the old kingdom. They are states bound to him and
to one another by a tie which is purely federal. That
the state whose prince holds Imperial rank far surpasses
any of its other members in extent and power
is an important political fact; but it does not touch the
federal position of all the states of the Empire, great
and small. Reuss-Schleiz is not a vassal of Prussia; it
is a member of a league in which the voice of Prussia
naturally goes for more than the voice of Reuss-Schleiz.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wars of the
French
Revolution,
1793-1814.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dissolution of the German kingdom, and with it
the wiping out of the last tradition of the Roman Empire,
cannot be separated from the history of wars of the
French Revolution which went before it, and which
indeed led to it. For our purely geographical purpose,
we must distinguish the changes which directly affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
the German kingdom from those which affected the
Austrian states, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, lands
which have now a separate historic being from Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>War between
France and
the Empire,
1793-1801.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The last war which the Empire as such waged with
France was the eight years’ war which was ended by the
Peace of Luneville.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The left
bank of the
Rhine ceded
by the
Peace of
Luneville,
1801.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By that peace, all Germany on the
left bank on the Rhine was ceded to France. What a
sacrifice this was we at once see, when we bear in mind
that it took in the three metropolitan cities of Köln,
Mainz, and Trier, the royal city of Aachen, and the
famous bishoprics of Worms and Speyer.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The <i>Reichs&shy;deputations&shy;haupt&shy;schluss</i>,
1803.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A number
of princes thus lost all or part of their dominions, and
it was presently agreed that they should compensate
themselves within the lands which remained to the
kingdom at the expense of the free cities and the ecclesiastical
princes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>End of the
Ecclesiastical
principalities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great German hierarchy of
princely bishops and abbots now came to an end, with
a solitary exception.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Prince-Primate
of
Regensburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the ancient metropolis of
Mainz had passed to France, the see of its archbishop
was removed to <i>Regensburg</i>, where, under the title
of <i>Prince-Primate</i>, he remained an Elector and Arch-Chancellor
of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Salzburg a
secular
electorate.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Salzburg</i> became a secular
electorate.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Free
Cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The other ecclesiastical states were annexed
by the neighbouring princes, and of the free
cities six only were left. These were the Hanseatic
towns of <i>Lübeck</i>, <i>Bremen</i>, and <i>Hamburg</i>, and the inland
towns of <i>Frankfurt</i>, <i>Nürnberg</i>, and <i>Augsburg</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New Electorates.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides
Salzburg, three new Electorates arose, <i>Württemberg</i>,
<i>Baden</i>, and <i>Hessen-Cassel</i>. None of these new Electors
ever chose any King or Emperor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Peace of
Pressburg,
1805.<br />
Kingdom of
Württemberg
and
Bavaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The next war led
to the Peace of Pressburg, in which the Electors of
Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden appear as allies of
France, and by which those of Bavaria and Württemberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
are acknowledged as Kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>They divide
the western
lands of
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Austria was now wholly
cut off from south-western Germany. Württemberg and
Baden divided her Swabian possessions, while Tyrol,
Trent, Brixen, together with the free city of Augsburg,
fell to the lot of Bavaria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grand
Duchy of
Würzburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Austria received Salzburg; its
prince removed himself and his electorate to Würzburg,
and a <i>Grand Duchy of Würzburg</i> was formed to
compensate its Elector.</p>

<p>These were the last changes which took place while
any shadow of the old Kingdom and Empire lasted.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Title of
‘Emperor of
Austria.’<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The reigning King of Germany and Emperor-elect,
Francis King of Hungary and Bohemia and Archduke
of Austria, had already begun to call himself ‘<i>Hereditary
Emperor of Austria</i>.’ In the treaty of Pressburg
he is described by the strange title, unheard of before
or after, of ‘Emperor of Germany and Austria,’ and
the Empire itself is spoken of as a ‘Germanic Confederation.’
These formulæ were prophetic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Confederation
of
the Rhine,
July 12,
1806.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The next year
a crowd of princes renounced their allegiance, and formed
themselves into the <i>Confederation of the Rhine</i> under
the protectorate of France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dissolution
of the Empire,
August
6, 1806.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The formal dissolution of
the Empire followed at once. The succession which
had gone on from Augustus ended; the work of Charles
the Great was undone. Instead of the Frank ruling
over Gaul, the Frenchman ruled over Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Repeated
changes,
1806-1811.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A time
of confusion followed, in which boundaries were constantly
shifting, states were constantly rising and falling,
and new portions of German ground were being constantly
added to France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Germany in
1811-1813.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the time of the greatest
extent of French dominion, the political state of Germany
was on this wise.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Territories
of Denmark
and Sweden.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dissolution of the Empire
had released all its members from their allegiance, and
the German possessions of the Kings of Denmark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
Sweden had been incorporated with their several kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Losses of
Prussia and
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Hannover was wholly lost to its island sovereign;
seized and lost again more than once by Prussia and by
France, it passed at last wholly into the hands of the
foreign power. Prussia had lost, not only its momentary
possession of Hannover, but also everything west of the
Elbe. Austria had yielded <i>Salzburg</i> to Bavaria, and
part of her own south-western territory in Krain and
Kärnthen had passed to France under the name of the
<i>Illyrian Provinces</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexations
to
France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
France too, beside all the lands
west of the Rhine, had incorporated <i>East Friesland</i>,
<i>Oldenburg</i>, part of <i>Hannover</i>, and the three <i>Hanseatic</i>
cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Confederation
of the
Rhine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The remaining states of Germany formed the
<i>Confederation of the Rhine</i>. The chief among these
were the four Kingdoms of <i>Bavaria</i>, <i>Württemberg</i>,
<i>Saxony</i>, and <i>Westfalia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdoms
of Saxony
and Westfalia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Saxony had become a kingdom
under its own Elector presently after the dissolution of
the Empire: the new-made kingdom of Westfalia had
a French king in Jerome Buonaparte.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grand
Duchy of
Frankfurt.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides <i>Mecklenburg</i>,
<i>Baden</i>—now a Grand Duchy—<i>Berg</i>, <i>Nassau</i>,
<i>Hessen</i>, and other smaller states, there were now among
its members the Grand Duchy of <i>Würzburg</i>, and also a
Grand Duchy of <i>Frankfurt</i>, the possession of the Prince
Primate, once of Mainz, afterwards of Regensburg.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Germany
wiped out.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We may say with truth that during this time Germany
had ceased to exist; its very name had vanished
from the map of Europe.</p>


<p class="p2">Prussia was a power so thoroughly German that
the fate even of its non-German possessions cannot
well be separated from German geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Kingdom of
Prussia cut
short, 1807.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The same
blow which cut short the old electorate of Brandenburg
no less cut short the kingdom of Prussia in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
its Polish acquisitions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Commonwealth
of
Danzig.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>West-Prussia</i> only was left,
and even here <i>Danzig</i> was cut off to form a separate
republic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Warsaw,
1806-1814.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The other Polish territories of Prussia formed
the <i>Duchy of Warsaw</i>, which was held by the new
King of Saxony.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
Silesia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Silesia thus fell back again on its
half-isolated position, all the more so as it lay between
the German and the Polish possessions of the
Saxon king. The territory left to Prussia was now
wholly continuous, without any outlying possessions;
but the length of its frontier and the strange irregularity
of its shape on the map were now more striking
than ever.</p>


<p class="p2">The liberation of Germany and the fall of Buonaparte
brought with it a complete reconstruction of the
German territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The German
Confederation,
1815.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Germany again arose, no longer as
an Empire or Kingdom, but as a lax Confederation.
Austria, the duchy whose princes had been so often
chosen Emperors, became its presiding state. The
boundaries of the new Confederation differed but
slightly from those of the old Kingdom; but the internal
divisions had greatly changed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Princes
holding
lands both
within the
Confederation
and out
of it.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Once more a
number of princes held lands both in Germany and out
of it. The so-called ‘Emperor’ of Austria, the Kings of
Prussia, Denmark, and the Netherlands, became members
of the Confederation for those parts of their
dominions which had formerly been states of the
Empire. In the like sort, the King of Great Britain
and Ireland, having recovered his continental dominions,
entered the Confederation by the title of <i>King of Hannover</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Hannover,
1815-1866.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This new kingdom was made up of the former
electorate with some additions, including <i>East-Friesland</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Increase of
the Prussian
territory.<br />
Dismemberment
of
Saxony.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In other parts the Prussian territories were largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
increased. <i>Magdeburg</i> and <i>Halberstadt</i> were recovered.
<i>Swedish Pomerania</i> was added to the rest of the ancient
duchy; and, more important than this, a large part of
the kingdom of <i>Saxony</i>, including the greater part of
<i>Lausitz</i> and the formerly outlying-land of <i>Cottbus</i>, was
incorporated with Prussia. This change, which made
the Saxon kingdom far smaller than the old electorate,
altogether put an end to the peninsular position of
Silesia, even as regarded the strictly German possessions
of Prussia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Posen.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The kingdom was at the same time rendered
more compact by the recovery of part of its Polish
possessions under the name of the Grand Duchy of
<i>Posen</i>. In western Germany again Prussia now made
great acquisitions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rhenish
and Westfalian
territory.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its old outlying Rhenish and
Westfalian possessions grew into a large and tolerably
compact territory, though lying isolated from
the great body of the monarchy. The greater part
of the territory west of the Rhine which had been
ceded to France now became Prussian, including the
cities of <i>Köln</i>, no longer a metropolitan see, <i>Trier</i>, <i>Münster</i>,
and <i>Paderborn</i>. The main part of the Prussian
possessions thus consisted of two detached masses,
of very unequal size, but which seemed to crave
for a closer geographical union.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neufchâtel.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Principality of
<i>Neufchâtel</i>, which made the Prussian king a member
of the Swiss Confederation, will be mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Territory
recovered
by Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Of the other powers which entered the Confederation
for the German parts of their dominions, but
which also had territories beyond the Confederation,
<i>Austria</i> recovered <i>Salzburg</i>, <i>Tyrol</i>, <i>Trent</i>, and <i>Brixen</i>,
together with the south-eastern lands which had passed
to France. Thus the territory of the Confederation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
like that of the old Kingdom, again reached to the
Hadriatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Possession
of Denmark.<br />
Holstein
and Lauenburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Denmark</i> entered the Confederation for <i>Holstein</i>,
and for a new possession, that of <i>Lauenburg</i>, the
duchy which in a manner represented ancient Saxony.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luxemburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The King of the <i>Netherlands</i> entered the Confederation
for the Grand Duchy of <i>Luxemburg</i>, part of which
however was cut off to be added to the Rhenish
possessions of Prussia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sweden
gives up
Pomerania.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Sweden, by the cession of its
last remnant of <i>Pomerania</i>, ceased altogether to be a
German power.</p>

<p>There were thus five powers whose dominions lay
partly within the Confederation, partly out of it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prussia the
greatest
German
Power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In
the case of one of these, that of Prussia, the division of
German and non-German territory was purely formal.
Prussia was practically a purely German power, and
the greatest of purely German powers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Her rival
Austria stood higher in formal rank in the Confederation,
and ruled over a much greater continuous territory;
but here the distinction between German and
non-German lands was really practical, as later events
have shown.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
of the position
of
Austria and
Prussia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It has been found possible to shut out
Austria from Germany. To shut out Prussia would
have been to abolish Germany altogether.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hannover.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Hannover,
though under a common sovereign with Great Britain,
was so completely cut off from Great Britain, and had
so little influence on British politics, that it was practically
as much a purely German state before its separation
from Great Britain as it was afterwards.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Holstein
and
Luxemburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the
cases of Denmark and the Netherlands, princes the
greater part of whose territories lay out of Germany
held adjoining territories in Germany. Here then were
materials for political questions and difficulties; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
in the case of Denmark, these questions and difficulties
became of the highest importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Bavaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Among those members of the Confederation, whose
territory lay wholly within Germany, the Kingdom
of <i>Bavaria</i> stood first. Its newly acquired lands to
the south were given back to Austria; but it made
large acquisitions to the north-east. Modern Bavaria
consists of a large mass of territory, Bavarian,
Swabian, and Frankish, counting within its boundaries
the famous cities of <i>Augsburg</i> and <i>Nürnberg</i> and
the great bishoprics of <i>Bamberg</i> and <i>Würzburg</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her Rhenish
territory.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides this, Bavaria recovered a considerable part
of the ancient Palatinate west of the Rhine, which
adds <i>Speyer</i> to the list of Bavarian cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Württemberg.<br />
Saxony.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The other
states which bore the kingly title, <i>Württemberg</i> and
the remnant of <i>Saxony</i>, were of much smaller extent.
Saxony however kept a position in many ways out
of all proportion to the narrowed extent of its geographical
limits. Württemberg, increased by various
additions from the <i>Swabian</i> lands of <i>Austria</i> and from
other smaller principalities, had, though the smallest
of kingdoms, won for itself a much higher position
than had been held by its former Counts and Dukes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Baden.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Along with them might be ranked the Grand Duchy
of <i>Baden</i>, with its strange irregular frontier, taking in
Heidelberg and Constanz.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hessen.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among a crowd of smaller
states stand out the two Hessian principalities, the
Grand Duchy of <i>Hessen-Darmstadt</i>, and <i>Hessen-Cassel</i>,
whose prince still kept the title of Elector, and the
Grand Duchy of <i>Nassau</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Oldenburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Grand Duchy of <i>Oldenburg</i>
nearly divided the Kingdom of Hannover into two
parts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Anhalt.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The principalities of <i>Anhalt</i> stretched into the
Prussian territory between Halberstadt and the newly-won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
Saxon lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Brunswick.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Duchy of <i>Brunswick</i> helped to
divide the two great masses of Prussian territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mecklenburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In
the north <i>Mecklenburg</i> remained, as before, unequally
divided between the Grand Dukes of <i>Schwerin</i> and
<i>Strelitz</i>. Germany was thus thoroughly mapped out
afresh. Some of the old names had vanished; some
had got new meanings. The greater states, with
the exception of Saxony, became greater. A crowd
of insignificant principalities passed away. Another
crowd of them remained, especially the smaller Saxon
duchies in the land which had once been Thuringian.
But, if we look to two of the most characteristic
features of the old Empire, we shall find that one
has passed away for ever, while the other was sadly
weakened.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>No ecclesiastical

The territory of one of the

became part of the new kingdom of Belgium.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The four

Of the
free cities four did revive, but four only. The three

the Confederation as independent commonwealths.

The Grand Duchy of <i>Luxemburg</i>, which had,
by the arrangements of 1815, been held by the King
of the Netherlands as a member of the German Confederation,
was, on the separation of Belgium and the
Netherlands, cut into two parts. Part was added to
Belgium; another part, though quite detached from the
kingdom of the Netherlands, was held by its king as
a member of the Confederation. In 1839 he also entered
it for the Duchy of Limburg.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>War in

The internal movements
which began in 1848, and the war in <i>Sleswick</i> and
<i>Holstein</i> which began in the same time, led to no lasting
geographical changes. In 1849 the Swabian principalities
of Hohenzollern were joined to the Prussian crown.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cession of

The last Danish war ended by the cession of Sleswick and

jointly, an arrangement in its own nature provisional.
Austria ceded her right in Lauenburg to Prussia in the
next year, and in the next year again came the Seven
Weeks’ War, and the great geographical changes which
followed it.

The German Confederation was abolished;

and she ceded her joint right in Sleswick and Holstein to
Prussia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Prussian annexations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Northern states of Germany became a
distinct Confederation under the presidency of Prussia,
whose immediate dominion was increased by the annexation
of the kingdom of <i>Hannover</i>, the duchy of <i>Nassau</i>,
the electorate of <i>Hessen</i>, and the city of <i>Frankfurt</i>. The
States south of the Main, Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden,
and the southern part of Hessen-Darmstadt, remained for
a while outside of the new League.

Sleswick, were now incorporated with the Confederation;
on the other hand, all that Austria had held within
the Confederation was now shut out of it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlement

<i>Luxemburg</i>
also was not included in the new League, and, after some

territory under its own duke the King of the Netherlands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Liechtenstein.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The little principality of <i>Liechtenstein</i> was perhaps
forgotten altogether; but, as not being included in
the Confederation, nor yet incorporated with anything
else, it must be looked on as becoming an absolutely
independent state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Great geographical
changes,
1866.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus the geographical frontiers of
Germany underwent, at a single blow, changes as great
as they had undergone in the wars of the French Revolution.
The geography of the presiding power of the
new League was no less changed.</p>

<p>That extraordinary extent of frontier which had
hitherto been characteristic of Prussia was not wholly
taken away by the new annexations, but it was greatly
lessened. The kingdom, as a kingdom, is made far
more compact, and the two great detached masses in
which it formerly lay are now joined together. Moreover,
the geographical character of Prussia becomes of
much less political importance, now that her frontier
marches to so great an extent on the smaller members
of the League of which she is herself President.

Next
came the war with France, the first effect of which
was the incorporation of the southern states of Germany
with the new League, which presently took the
name of an Empire, with the Prussian King as hereditary
Emperor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovery of

Then by the peace with France, nearly
the whole of <i>Elsass</i> and part of <i>Lotharingia</i>, including
the cities of <i>Strassburg</i> and <i>Metz</i>, were restored to
Germany. They have, under the name of <i>Elsass-Lothringen</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
become an Imperial territory, forming
part of the Empire and owning the sovereignty of
the Emperor, but not becoming part of the kingdom of
Prussia or of any other German state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Imperial
title.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The assumption
of the Imperial title could hardly be avoided in a
confederation whose constitution was monarchic, and
which numbered kings among its members. No title
but Emperor could have been found to express the
relation between the presiding chief and the lesser
sovereigns.</p>

Comparison
of the old
Kingdom
and the
new Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Still it must be borne in mind that the new German
Empire is in no sense a continuation or restoration of
the Holy Roman Empire which fell sixty-four years
before its creation. But it may be fairly looked on as
a restoration of the old German Kingdom, the Kingdom
of the East-Franks. Still, as far as geography
is concerned, no change can be stranger than the
change in the boundaries of Germany between the ninth
century and the nineteenth. The new Empire, cut short
to the north-west, south-west, and south-east, has grown
somewhat to the north, and it has grown prodigiously
to the north-east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Name of
<i>Prussia</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its ruling state, a state which
contains such illustrious cities as Köln, Trier, and
Frankfurt, is content to call itself after an extinct
heathen people whose name had most likely never
reached the ears of Charles the Great.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
Berlin.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The capital of the
new Empire, placed far away from any of the antient

long after, was a Slavonic land.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formation
of the new
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Germany, with its
chief state bearing the name of <i>Prussia</i>, with the place
of its national assemblies transferred from Frankfurt to
Berlin, presents one of the strangest changes that historical
geography can show us. But, strange as is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
geographical change, it has come about gradually, by
the natural working of historical causes. The Slavonic
and Prussian lands have been Germanized, while the
western parts of the old kingdom which have fallen away
have mostly lost their German character. Those German
lands which have formed the kernel of the Swiss
Confederation have risen to a higher political state than
that of any kingdom or Empire. But the German
lands which still remain so strangely united to the
lands of the Magyar and the southern Slave await, at
however distant a time, their natural and inevitable reunion.
So does a Danish population in the extreme
north await, with less hope, its no less natural separation
from the German body. Posen, still mainly Slavonic,
remains unnaturally united to a Teutonic body, but
it is not likely to gain by a transfer to any other ruler.
The reconstruction of the German realm in its present
shape, a shape so novel to the eye, but preserving
so much of ancient life and ancient history, has been
the greatest historical and geographical change of our
times.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>The Kingdom of Italy.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Small geographical
importance
of the kingdom
as
such.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We parted from the Italian kingdom at the moment
of its separation from the Eastern and Western kingdoms
of the Franks. Its history, as a kingdom, consists in
little more than its reunion with the East-Frankish
crown, and in the way in which the royal power gradually
died out within its limits. There is but little to
say as to any changes of frontier of the kingdom as
such. As long as Germany, Italy, and Burgundy acknowledged
a single king, any shiftings of the frontiers
of his three kingdoms were of secondary importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
When the power of the Emperors in Italy had died
out, the land became a system of independent commonwealths
and principalities, which had hardly that degree
of unity which could enable us to say that a certain
territory was added to Italy or taken from it. Even if
a certain territory passed from an Italian to a German
or Burgundian lord, the change was rather a change in
the frontier of this or that Italian state than in the frontier
of Italy itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes on
the Alpine
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The shiftings of frontier along the
whole Alpine border have been considerable; but it is
only in our own day that we can say that Italy as such
has become capable of extending or lessening her
borders.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Case of
Verona.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
When, in 1866, Venice and Verona were
added to the Italian kingdom, that was a distinct change
in the frontier of Italy. We can hardly give that
name to endless earlier changes on the same marchland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Case of
Trieste,
1380.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the fourteenth century, for instance, the town of
<i>Trieste</i>, disputed between the patriarchs of Aquileia
and the commonwealth of Venice, was acknowledged
as an independent state, and it presently gave up its
independence by commendation to the Duke of Austria.
It is not likely that the question entered into any man’s
mind whether the frontiers of the German and Italian
kingdoms were affected by such a change. Whether as a
free city or as an Austrian lordship, Trieste remained
under the superiority, formally undoubted but practically
nominal, of the common sovereign of Germany and Italy,
the Roman Emperor or King. Whether the nominal
allegiance of the city was due to him in his German
or in his Italian character most likely no one stopped
to think.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>No eastern
or western
frontiers.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
East and west, the Italian kingdom had no
frontiers; the only question which could arise was as
to the relation of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
the kingdom itself or to any of the states which arose
within it. To the south lay the independent Lombard
duchies, and the possessions which still remained to the
Eastern Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Norman
kingdom
of
Sicily not
an Imperial
fief.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These changed in time into the
Norman duchy of <i>Apulia</i> and kingdom of <i>Sicily</i>; but
that kingdom, held as it was as a fief of the see of
Rome, was never incorporated with the Italian kingdom
of the Emperors, nor did its kings ever become
the men of the Emperor. Particular Emperors in
the thirteenth century, in the sixteenth, and in the
eighteenth, were also kings of one or both the Sicilian
kingdoms; but at no time before our own day were
Sicily and southern Italy ever incorporated with a
Kingdom of Italy. When we remember that it was to
the southern part of the peninsula that the name of
Italy was first given, we see here a curiosity of nomenclature
as remarkable as the shiftings of meaning
in the names of Saxony and Burgundy.</p>

<p>Naples and Sicily then, the Two Sicilies of later
political nomenclature, lie outside our present subject.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venice no
part of
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
So does the commonwealth of <i>Venice</i>, except so far as
Venice afterwards won a large subject territory on the
Italian mainland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her Italian
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Both these states have to do with
Italy as a geographical expression, but neither the
Venetian commonwealth nor the Sicilian kingdom is
Italian within the meaning of the present section. They
formed no part of the Carolingian dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venice and
the Sicilies
part of the
Eastern
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They
were parts of the Eastern Empire, not of the Western.
They remained attached to the New Rome after an
Imperial throne had again been set up in the Old.
They gradually fell away from their allegiance to
the Eastern Empire, but they were never incorporated
with the Empire of the West. I shall deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
with them here only in their relations to the Imperial
Kingdom of Italy, and treat of their special history
elsewhere among the states which arose out of the
break-up of the Eastern Empire. Again, on the north-western
march of Italy a power gradually arose, partly
Italian, but for a long time mainly Burgundian, which
has in the end, by a strange fate, grown into a new
Italian Kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The House
of Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This is the House of <i>Savoy</i>. The
growth of the dominions of that house, the process
by which it gradually lost territory in Burgundy and
gained it in <i>Italy</i>, form another distinct subject.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its special
history.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It
will be dealt with here only in its relations to the kingdom
of Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Kingdom
of Italy
continues
the Lombard
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Italian Kingdom of the Karlings, the kingdom
which was reunited to Germany under Otto the Great,
was, as has been already said, a continuation of the old
Lombard kingdom. It consisted of that kingdom,
enlarged by the Italian lands which fell off from the
Eastern Empire in the eighth century; that is by the
<i>Exarchate</i> and the adjoining <i>Pentapolis</i>, and the immediate
territory of <i>Rome</i> itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austria
and Neustria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Lombard kingdom,
in the strictest sense, took in the two provinces north of
the Po, in which we again find, as in other lands, an
<i>Austria</i> to the east and a <i>Neustria</i> to the west.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Æmilia.<br />
Tuscany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It
took in <i>Æmilia</i> south of the Po—the district of Piacenza,
Parma, Reggio, and Modena—also <i>Tuscany</i>, a
name, which, as it no longer reaches to the Tiber,
answers pretty nearly to its modern use.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Romagna.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Tuscan
name has lived on; the Exarchate and Pentapolis, as
having been the chief seat of the later Imperial power
in Italy, got the name of <i>Romania</i>, <i>Romandiola</i>, or
<i>Romagna</i>. This name also lives on; but the Lombard
Neustria and Austria soon vanish from the map. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
disappearance was perhaps lucky, as one knows not
what arguments might otherwise have been built on
the presence of an Austria south of the Alps.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lombardy
proper.<br />
Venetia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Lombard Neustria together with Æmilia got the special
name of <i>Lombardy</i>, while the Lombard Austria, after
various shiftings of names taken from the principalities
which rose and fell within it, came back in the end
to its oldest name, that of <i>Venetia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mark of
Ivrea.<br />
Duchy of
Friuli.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the north-west
corner <i>Iporedia</i> or <i>Ivrea</i> appears as a distinct march;
but the Venetian march at the other corner, known at
this stage as the duchy of <i>Friuli</i>, is of more importance.
It takes in the county of <i>Trent</i>, the special march of
<i>Friuli</i>, and the march of <i>Istria</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuation
of boundary
at the
north-west
corner.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This is the corner
in which the German and Italian frontier has so often
fluctuated. We have seen that, after the union of the
Italian and German crowns, even Verona itself was
sometimes counted as German ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
of Italy and
Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Under the German kings Italy came under the
same influences as the other two Imperial kingdoms.
Principalities grew up; free cities grew up; but, while
in Germany the principalities were the rule and the
cities the exception, in Italy it was the other way.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of a
system of
commonwealths
in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The land gradually became a system of practically
independent commonwealths. Feudal princes, ecclesiastical
or temporal, flourished only in the north-western
and north-eastern corners of the kingdom. But, if the
range of the German cities was less wide, and their
career less brilliant, than those of Italy, their freedom
was more lasting.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tyrants
grow into
princes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Italian cities gradually fell
under tyrants, and the tyrants gradually grew into
acknowledged princes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of

The Bishops of Rome too, by
a series of claims dexterously pressed at various times,
contrived to form the greatest of ecclesiastical principalities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
one which stretched across the peninsula from
sea to sea.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Four stages
of Italian
history.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The geographical history of Italy consists
of four stages. In the first the kingdom fell asunder
into principalities. In the second the principalities
vanished before the growth of the free cities. In the
third the cities were again massed into principalities,
till in the fourth the principalities were at last merged
in a kingdom of united Italy.</p>


<p class="p2">Under the Saxon and Frankish Emperors the old
Lombard names of Neustria and Æmilia pass away.
Several small marches lie along the Burgundian frontier,
as <i>Savona</i> on the coast, <i>Ivrea</i> among the mountains
to the north-west, between them <i>Montferrat</i>, <i>Vasto</i>, and
<i>Susa</i>, whose princes, as special guardians of the passage
between the two kingdoms, bore the title of Marquess
in Italy. It was in this region that the feudal princes
were strongest, and that the system of free cities had
the smallest developement.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Marquesses
of
Montferrat,
938-1533.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Savoyard power was
already beginning to grow up in the extreme north-west
corner; but at this time a greater part in strictly Italian
history is played by the Marquesses of Montferrat, who
for many centuries kept their position as important
feudal princes quite apart from the lords of the cities.
In the north-east corner of the kingdom the place of the
old Austria is taken by the border principalities where
the Italian, the German, and the Slave all come in
contact, and which fluctuated more than once between
the Italian and the German crowns. We have here the
great march of Verona, beyond it that of Friuli, Trent,
the marchland of the marchland, between Verona and
Bavaria, and the Istrian peninsula on the Slavonic
side of the Hadriatic. Between the border districts on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
either side lay the central land, Lombardy, in the narrower
sense, the chosen home of the free cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
the Lombard
cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Here,
by the middle of the twelfth century, every city had
practically become a separate commonwealth, owning
only the most nominal superiority in the Emperor.
Guelfic cities withstood the Emperor; Ghibelin cities
welcomed him; but both were practically independent
commonwealths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wars of the
Swabian
Emperors.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Hence came those long wars between
the Swabian Emperors and the Italian cities which form
the chief feature of Italian history in the second half of
the twelfth century and the first half of the thirteenth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Milan and
Pavia.<br />
The other
Lombard
cities.<br />
Alessandria,
1168.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Round the younger and the elder capital, round Guelfic
Milan and Ghibelin Pavia, gathered a crowd of famous
names, <i>Como</i>, <i>Bergamo</i>, and <i>Brescia</i>, <i>Lodi</i>, <i>Crema</i>,
and <i>Cremona</i>, <i>Tortona</i>, <i>Piacenza</i>, and <i>Parma</i>, and
<i>Alessandria</i>, the trophy of republican and papal victory
over Imperial power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Verona and
Padua.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Veronese march was less rich
in cities of the same historical importance;
but both
<i>Verona</i> itself and <i>Padua</i> played a great part, as the
seats first of commonwealths, then of tyrants. Further
north and east, the civic element was weaker again.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Trent.<br />
Aquileia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Trent</i> gradually parted off from Italy to become an
ecclesiastical principality of the German kingdom;
and the Patriarchs of <i>Aquileia</i> grew into powerful
princes at the north-eastern corner of the Hadriatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The lords of
Romano
and Este.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Within the Veronese or Trevisan march itself, the
lords of <i>Romano</i> and the more important marquesses
of <i>Este</i> also demand notice. Romano gave the Trevisan
march its famous tyrant Eccelino in the days of
Frederick the Second, and the Marquesses of Este,
kinsmen of the great Saxon dukes, came in time to
rank among the chief Italian princes.

The extreme

that it will be better treated in tracing the growth of

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tuscany,
Romagna,
and the
March of
Ancona.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">In the more central lands of the kingdom, in the
old exarchate, now known as <i>Romagna</i>, in the march
variously called by the names of <i>Camerino</i>, <i>Fermo</i>, or
<i>Ancona</i>, and above all in the march of <i>Tuscany</i> on the
southern sea, the same developement of city life also
took place, but somewhat later. North of the Apennines,
along the Hadriatic coast, arose a crowd of
small commonwealths which gradually passed into
small tyrannies.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Tuscan
commonwealths.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Tuscany, on the other hand, was
parted off into a few commonwealths of illustrious
name. For a while one of these ran a course which
stood rather apart from the common run of Italian
history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pisa;<br />
her wars
with the
Saracens
1005-1115.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Pisa</i>, then one of the great maritime and commercial
states of Europe, became, early in the eleventh
century, a power which forestalled the crusades and
won back lands from the Saracen. Though she was
in every sense a city of the Italian kingdom, Pisa at
this time held a position not unlike that which was
afterwards held by Venice. Like her, she was a power
which colonized and conquered beyond the seas, but
which came only gradually to take a share in the
main course of Italian affairs.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Genoa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Beyond the borders of
Tuscany, the same position was held by <i>Genoa</i> on the
Ligurian gulf.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Occupation
of the island
of Sardinia

and of Corsica
by
Genoa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Pisa won <i>Sardinia</i> from the Saracen;
Genoa, after long disputes with Pisa, obtained a more
lasting possession of <i>Corsica</i>. Returning to Tuscany,
three great commonwealths here grew up, which gradually
divided the land between them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lucca,
Siena,
Florence.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were
<i>Lucca</i> and <i>Siena</i>, and <i>Florence</i>, the last of Italian
cities to rise to greatness, but the one which became
in many ways the greatest among her fellows.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Perugia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
centre of Italy, within the bounds of old Etruria but
not within those of modern Tuscany, <i>Perugia</i>, both as
commonwealth and as tyranny, held a high place among
Italian cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rome.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of Rome herself it is almost impossible
to speak. She has much history, but she has little
geography. Emperors were crowned there; Popes
sometimes lived there; sometimes Rome appears once
more as a single Latin city, waging war against Tusculum
or some other of her earliest fellows.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Claims of
the Popes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
claims of her Bishops to independent temporal power,
founded on a succession of real or pretended Imperial
and royal grants, lay still in the background; but they
were ready to grow into reality as occasion served.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second
stage, c.
1250-1530.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The next stage of Italian political geography may
be dated from the death of Frederick the Second, when
all practical power of an Imperial kingdom in Italy may
be said to have passed away.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
tyrannies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Presently begins the
gradual change of the commonwealths into tyrannies,
and the grouping together of many of them into larger
states. We also see the beginning of more definite
claims of temporal dominion on behalf of the Popes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dominion
of Spain,
1555-1701.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the course of the three hundred years between
Frederick the Second and Charles the Fifth, these
processes gradually changed the face of the Italian
kingdom. It became in the end a collection of principalities,
broken only by the survival of a few oligarchic
commonwealths and by the anomalous dominion of
Venice on the mainland. Between Frederick the
Second and Charles the Fifth, we may look on the
Empire as practically in abeyance in Italy. The coming
of an Emperor always caused a great stir for the
time, but it was only for the time.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grant of
Rudolf,
1278.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After the grant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
of Rudolf of Habsburg to the Popes, a distinction was
drawn between Imperial and papal territory in Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Imperial
and papal
fiefs.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
While certain princes and commonwealths still acknowledged
at least the nominal superiority of the
Emperor, others were now held to stand in the same
relation of vassalage to the Pope.</p>

<p>We must now trace out the growth of the chief
states which were formed by these several processes.
Beginning again in the north, it must be remembered
that all this while the power of Savoy was advancing
in those north-western lands in which the influences
which mainly ruled this period had less force than
elsewhere. Montferrat too kept its old character of
a feudal principality, a state whose rulers had in various
ways a singular connexion with the East.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Palaiologoi
at Montferrat,
1306.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As
Marquesses of Montferrat had claimed the crown of
Jerusalem and had worn the crown of Thessalonica, so,
as if to keep even the balance between East and West, in
return a branch of the Imperial house of Palaiologos
came to reign at Montferrat. To the east of these more
ancient principalities, two great powers of quite different
kinds grew up in the old Neustria and Austria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Milan.
Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These
were the <i>Duchy of Milan</i> and the land power of <i>Venice</i>.
Milan, like most other Italian cities, came under the influence
of party leaders, who grew first into tyrants and
then into acknowledged sovereigns.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Visconti
at
Milan,
1310-1447.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These at Milan,
after the shorter domination of the Della Torre, were the
more abiding house of the Visconti. Their dominion,
after various fluctuations and revolutions, was finally
established when the coming of the Emperor Henry the
Seventh generally strengthened the rule of the Lords
of the cities throughout Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grant of the
Duchy by
King
Wenceslaus,
1395.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At the end of the fourteenth
century their informal lordship passed by a royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
grant into an acknowledged duchy of the Empire. The
dominion which they had gradually gained, and which
was thus in a manner legalized, took in all the great
cities of Lombardy, those especially which had formed
the Lombard League against the Swabian Emperors.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Pavia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Pavia indeed, the ancient rival of Milan, kept a kind of
separate being, and was formed into a distinct county.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the duchy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the duchy granted by Wenceslaus to Gian-Galeazzo
stretched far on both sides of the lake of Garda.
<i>Belluno</i> at one end and <i>Vercelli</i> at the other formed
part of it. It took in the mountain lands which
afterwards passed to the two Alpine Confederations;
it took in <i>Parma</i>, <i>Piacenza</i>, and <i>Reggio</i> south of
the Po, and <i>Verona</i> and <i>Vicenza</i> in the old Austrian
or Venetian land. Besides all this, <i>Padua</i>, <i>Bologna</i>,
even <i>Genoa</i> and <i>Pisa</i>, passed at various times under
the lordship of the Visconti. But this great power
was not lasting. The Duchy of Milan, under various
lords, native and foreign, lasted till the wars of the
French Revolution; but, long before that time, it
had been cut short on every side.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Decrease on
the death of
Gian Galeazzo,
1402.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The death of the
first Duke was followed by a separation of the duchy
of Milan and the county of Pavia between his sons,
and the restored duchy never rose again to its former
power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The eastern
cities won
by Venice,
1406-1447.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The eastern parts, Padua, Verona, Brescia,
Bergamo, were gradually added to the dominion of
Venice. By the middle of the fifteenth century, that
republic had become the greatest power in northern
Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>House of
Sforza,
1450-1535.<br />
Claims of
the Kings
of France,
1499-1525.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the duchy of Milan the house of Sforza
succeeded that of Visconti;
but the opposing claims
of the Kings of France were one chief cause of the
long wars which laid Italy waste in the latter years
of the fifteenth century and the early years of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
sixteenth. The duchy was tossed to and fro between
the Emperor, the French King, and its own dukes.
Meanwhile the dominion which was thus struggled
for was cut short at the two ends.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cession to
the Alpine
Leagues,
1512-1513.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was dismembered
to the north in favour of the two Alpine
Leagues, as will be hereafter shown more in detail.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Popes
obtain
Parma and
Piacenza,
1515.<br />
Duchy of
Parma and
Piacenza,
1545.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
South of the Po, the Popes obtained <i>Parma</i> and
<i>Piacenza</i>, which were afterwards granted as papal fiefs
to form a duchy for the house of Farnese. Thus the
Duchy of Milan which became in the end a possession
of Charles the Fifth, and afterwards of his Spanish
and Austrian successors, was but a remnant of the great
dominion of the first Duke. The duchy underwent still
further dismemberments in later times.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Land power
of Venice
only.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>With Venice we have here to deal in her somewhat
unnatural position as an Italian land power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>War of the
League of
Cambray,
1508-1517.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This position
she took on herself in the fifteenth century; in
the sixteenth it led to the momentary overthrow and
wonderful recovery of her dominion in the war of the
League of Cambray. This land power of Venice stands
quite distinct from the Venetian possessions east of
the Hadriatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Istria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
With this last her possession of the
coast of the <i>Istrian</i> peninsula must be reckoned, rather
than with her Italian dominions. Between these lay
Aquileia, Trieste, and the other lands in this quarter
which gradually came under the power of Austria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
Venetian
dominion.<br />
Ravenna,
1441-1530.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The continuous Italian dominion of Venice took in
<i>Udine</i> at one end and <i>Bergamo</i> at the other, besides
<i>Crema</i>, and for a while <i>Ravenna</i>, as outlying possessions.
Thus the Byzantine city which lay anchored off the
shore of the Western Empire could for a season call
the ancient seat of the Exarchate its own.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Two parts of
the Venetian
territory.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But even
the continuous land territory of Venice lay in two portions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
Brescia and Bergamo were almost cut off from
Verona and the other possessions to the east by the
Lake of Garda, the bishopric of Trent to the north,
and the principality of <i>Mantua</i> to the south.</p>

<p>The mention of this last state leads us back again to
the commonwealths which, like Milan, changed, first into
tyrannies, and then into acknowledged principalities.
It is impossible to mention all of them, and some of
those which played for a while the most brilliant part in
Italian history had no lasting effect on Italian geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rule of the
Scala at
Verona,
1260-1387;

at
Padua,
1318-1405;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The rule of the house of Scala at Verona, the rule of the
house of Carrara at Padua, left no lasting trace on the
map. It was otherwise with the two states which bordered
on the Venetian possessions to the south.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of the Gonzaga
at
Mantua,
1328-1708.
Marquesses,
1433;
Dukes, 1530.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
house of Gonzaga held sovereign power at <i>Mantua</i>,
first as captains, then as marquesses, then as dukes,
for nearly four hundred years.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>House of
Este.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of greater fame was
the power that grew up in the house of <i>Este</i>, the
Italian branch of the house of Welf. Their position
is one specially instructive, as illustrating the various
tenures by which dominion was held.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The lords of
Ferrara and
Modena,
1264-1288.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The marquesses
of Este, feudal lords of that small principality, became,
after some of the usual fluctuations, permanent
lords of the cities of <i>Ferrara</i> and <i>Modena</i>. About
the same time they lost their original holding of Este,
which passed to Padua, and with Padua to Venice.
Thus the nominal marquess of Este and real lord of
Ferrara was not uncommonly spoken of as Marquess of
Ferrara. In the fifteenth century these princes rose to
ducal rank; but by that time the new doctrine of the
temporal dominion of the Popes had made great
advances. Modena, no man doubted, was a city of the
Empire; but Ferrara was now held to be under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
supremacy of the Pope. The Marquess Borso had thus
to seek his elevation to ducal rank from two separate
lords.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Modena,
1453.<br />
Duchy of
Ferrara,
1471.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
He was created Duke of Modena and Reggio
by the Emperor, and afterwards Duke of Ferrara by the
Pope. This difference of holding, as we shall presently
see, led to the destruction of the power of the house
of Este. In the times in which we are now concerned,
their dominions lay in two masses. To the west lay
the duchy of Modena and Reggio; apart from it to the
east lay the duchy of Ferrara.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Rovigo,
1484.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Not long after its creation,
this last duchy was cut short by the surrender of
the border-district of <i>Rovigo</i> to Venice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cities of
Romagna.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Between the two great duchies of the house of Este
lay <i>Bologna</i>, gradually changed from <i>Romania</i> in one
sense into <i>Romagna</i> in another. Like most other Italian
cities, the commonwealths of the Exarchate and the Pentapolis
changed into tyrannies, and their petty princes
were one by one overthrown by the advancing power of
the Popes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bologna,
Perugia,
Rimini.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Every city had its dynasty; but it was only
a few, like the houses of <i>Bentevoglio</i> at <i>Bologna</i>, of <i>Baglioni</i>
at <i>Perugia</i>, and <i>Malatesta</i> at <i>Rimini</i>, that rose to
any historical importance. One only combined historical
importance with acknowledged princely rank.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Duchy
of Urbino,
1478-1631.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
house of <i>Montefeltro</i>, lords of <i>Urbino</i>, became acknowledged
dukes by papal grants. From them the duchy
passed to the house of La Rovere, and it flourished
under five princes of the two dynasties.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Expansion
of the papal
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Gradually, by
successive annexations, the papal dominions, before the
middle of the sixteenth century, stretched from the Po
to Tarracina. Ferrara and Urbino still remained distinct
states, but states which were confessedly held as fiefs of
the Holy See.</p>

<p>To the west, in Tuscany, the phænomena are somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
different. The characteristic of this part of Italy
was the grouping together of the smaller cities under
the power of the larger. Nearly all the land came
in the end under princely rule; but both acknowledged
princely rule and the tyrannies out of which it
sprang came into importance in Tuscany later than
anywhere else.

<h3>§ 4. <i>The Later Geography of Italy.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Abeyance of
the kingdom
of
Italy, 1530-1805.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Under Charles the Fifth it might have seemed that
both the Roman Empire and the kingdom of Italy had
come to life again. A prince who wore both crowns
was practically master of Italy. But though the power
of the Emperor was restored, the power of the Empire
was not. In truth we may look on all notion of a kingdom
of Italy in the elder sense as having passed away
with the coronation of Charles himself. The thing
had passed away long before; after the pageant at
Bologna the name was not heard for more than two
centuries and a half.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Italy a geographical
expression.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Italy became truly a ‘geographical
expression;’ the land consisted of a number of
principalities and a few commonwealths, all nominally
independent, some more or less practically so, but the
more part of which were under foreign influence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
some of them were actually ruled by foreign princes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes
among the
Italian
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
states of Italy were united, divided, handed over from
one ruler to another, according to the fluctuations of war
and diplomacy, without any regard either to the will of
the inhabitants or to the authority of any central power.
A practically dominant power there was during the
greater part of this period; but it was not the power
of even a nominal King of Italy. For a long time that
dominant power was held by the House of Austria in
its two branches. The supremacy of Charles in Italy
passed, not to his Imperial brother, but to his Spanish
son.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dominion
of Spain,
1555-1701;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then followed the long dominion of the Spanish
branch of the Austrian house; then came the less
thorough dominion of the German branch.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of Austria,
1713-1793.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last
was a dominion strictly of the House of Austria as such,
not of the Empire or of either of the Imperial kingdoms.
And now that the name of Italy means merely a certain
surface on the map, we must take some notice, so far
as they regard Italian history, at once of Savoy at one
end and of the Sicilian kingdoms at the other. From
this time both of them have a more direct bearing on
Italian history.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Massing of
Italy into
larger
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By the time of the coronation of Charles the Fifth,
or at least within the generation which could remember
his coronation, the greater part of Italy had been
massed into a few states, which, as compared with the
earlier state of things, were of considerable size.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Monaco<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A few
smaller principalities and lordships still kept their place,
of which one of the smallest, that of <i>Monaco</i> in the
extreme south-west, has lived on to our own time.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>San Marino<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
So has
the small commonwealth of <i>San Marino</i>, surrounded,
first by the dominions of the Popes and now by the
modern kingdom. But such states as these were mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>

But the duchy, as an Austrian possession,

The marquisate

Montferrat was disputed between the Dukes of Savoy

At last, by one of
the last exercises of Imperial authority in Italy, the
duchy of Mantua itself was held to be forfeited to the
Empire; that is, it became an Austrian possession. At
the same time the Imperial authority confirmed Montferrat
to Savoy. The Austrian dominions in Italy were thus
extended to the south-east by the accession of the
Mantuan territory; but the whole western frontier of
the Milanese now lay open to Savoyard advance.

<p class="pb2">Thus, except on the frontier of Piedmont and
Milan, the whole time from Charles the Fifth to the

frontiers of the several states than for the way
in which they are passed to and fro from one master to
another.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of

This is yet more remarkable, if we look to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>

The Norman kingdom
which, by steps which will be told elsewhere, grew up to

ever changed its boundaries, except by the various

kingdom.

Even the outlying papal possession

have been endless.

The revolt of the island split the

which called itself the <i>Kingdom of Sicily</i>, though the
continental realm was more commonly known as the
<i>Kingdom of Naples</i>. The wars of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries caused endless changes of dynasty

The French
invasion under Charles the Eighth and the long wars

Sicilian kingdoms, now known as the <i>Kingdom of the

Spanish monarchy.

A momentary separation of the

In the division of the Spanish monarchy,
Sardinia and Naples fell to the lot of the Austrian
House, while Sicily was given to the Duke of
Savoy, who thus gained substantial kingly rank.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Exchange
of Sicily

Presently
the kings of the two island kingdoms made an
exchange; Sardinia passed to Savoy, and the Emperor
Charles the Sixth ruled, like Frederick the Second and
Charles the Fifth, over both Sicilies.

Lastly, the kingdom
was handed over from an Austrian to a new
Spanish master, the first of the line of Neapolitan
Bourbons. Thus, at the end of the last century, the
Two Sicilies formed a distinct and united kingdom,
while Sardinia formed the outlying realm of the Duke
of Savoy and Prince of Piedmont. His kingdom was
of far less value than his principality or his duchy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
name <i>Sardinia</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, as Sardinia gave their common sovereign his

its king.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Time of the
Revolution,
1797-1814.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This period, a period of change, but of comparatively
slight geographical change, was followed by a time
when, in Italy as in Germany, boundaries were changed,
new names were invented or forgotten names revived,
when old land-marks were rooted up, and thrones were
set up and cast down, with a speed which baffles the
chronicler. The first strictly geographical change
which was wrought in Italy by the revolutionary wars
was a characteristic one.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cispadane Republic,
1796.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A <i>Cispadane Republic</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
first of a number of momentary commonwealths bearing
names dug up from the recesses of bygone times,
took in the duchy of Modena and the Papal Legations
of Romagna. Without exactly following the same
boundaries, it answered roughly to the old Exarchate.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Transpadane
Republic, 1797.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then the French victories over Austria caused the
Austrian duchies of Milan and Mantua to become a
<i>Transpadane Republic</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Treaty of
Campo
Formio,
1797.
Cisalpine
Republic.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then Venice was wiped out at
Campo Formio, and her Lombard possessions were joined
together with the two newly made commonwealths, to
form a <i>Cisalpine Republic</i>. But the same treaty wrought
another change which was more distinctly geographical.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venice surrendered
to
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Venice and the eastern part of her possessions on the
mainland, the old Venetia, the Lombard <i>Austria</i>, was
now handed over to the modern state which bore the
latter name. This change may be looked on as distinctly
cutting short the boundaries of Italy. The duchy of
Milan in Austrian hands had been an outlying part
of the Austrian dominions; but Venetia marches on
the older territory of the Austrian house, and was
thus more completely severed from Italy. The whole
north of the Hadriatic coast thus became Austrian in the
modern sense. One Italian commonwealth—for Venice
had long counted as Italian—was thus wiped out, and
handed over to a foreign king. But elsewhere, at
this stage of revolutionary progress, the fashion ran in
favour of the creation of local commonwealths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ligurian
Republic,
1797.<br />
Parthenopæan
Republic.<br />
Tiberine
Republic,
1798-1801.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
dominions of Genoa became a <i>Ligurian Republic</i>;
Naples became a <i>Parthenopæan Republic</i>; Rome herself
exchanged for a moment the memories of kings,
consuls, emperors, and pontiffs to become the head of a
<i>Tiberine Republic</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Piedmont

Piedmont was overwhelmed; the

small parts were added to the neighbouring republics,
and the king of Sardinia withdrew to his island kingdom.
Amid this crowd of new-fangled states and new-fangled
names, ancient San Marino still lived on.</p>

<p>Thus far revolutionary Italy followed the example of
revolutionary France, and the new states were all at
least nominal commonwealths. In the next stage,
when France came under the rule of a single man,
above all when that single ruler took on him the Imperial
title, the tide turned in favour of monarchy. In
Rome and Naples it had already turned so in another
way.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Restoration

King of the

By help of the Czar and the Sultan, the new republics
vanished, and the old rulers, Pope and King,
came back again. And now France herself began to
create kingdoms instead of commonwealths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Etruria,
1801-1808.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Parma

Italy herself gave her name to a kingdom.

The Cisalpine
republic, further enlarged by Venice and the other

also by the <i>Valtellina</i> and the former bishopric of
<i>Trent</i> at one end and by the march of <i>Ancona</i> at the
other, became the <i>Kingdom of Italy</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Buonaparte
king of
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its King, the first
since Charles the Fifth who had worn the Italian crown,
was no other than the new ruler of France, the self-styled
‘Emperor.’ But, in Buonaparte’s later distributions
of Italian territory, it was not his Italian kingdom,
but his French ‘empire’ whose frontiers were extended.

The Ligurian Republic was annexed;
so before
long was the new kingdom of Etruria;

was made into a grand duchy for the conqueror’s
sister.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Incorporation

Lastly, Rome itself, with what was left of the
papal dominions, was also incorporated with the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
dominion. The work alike of Cæsar and of Charles
was wiped out from the Eternal City. The Empire of
the Gauls, which Civilis had dreamed of more than
seventeen centuries before, had come at last.</p>

<p>The fate of the remainder of the peninsula had been
already sealed before Rome became French. The kingdom
of the Two Sicilies fell asunder. The Bourbon
king kept his island, as the Savoyard king kept his.

But the outlying Tuscan possessions of

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Italy under
French
dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">Thus all Italy—unless we count the island kingdoms

under French dominion in one form or another. But
of that dominion there were three varieties.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Part incorporated

France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The whole
western part of the land, from Aosta to Tarracina—unless

duchy—was formally incorporated with France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the kingdom
of
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
north-eastern side, from Bözen to Ascoli, formed a
Kingdom of Italy, distinct from France, but held by
the same sovereign. And this Kingdom of Italy was
further increased to the north by part of those Italian
lands which had become Swiss and German.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Naples.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Southern
Italy, the Kingdom of Naples, remained in form an independent
kingdom; but it was held by princes who could
not be looked on as anything but the humble vassals
of their mighty kinsman. Never had Italy been brought
more completely under foreign dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Revival of
the Italian
name.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Still, in a
part at least of the land, the name of Italy, and the
shadow of a Kingdom of Italy, had been revived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its effects.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, as names and shadows are not without influence
in human affairs, the mere existence of an Italian
state, called by the Italian name, did something. The
creation of a sham Italy was no unimportant step
towards the creation of a real one.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlement
of, 1814-1815.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">The settlement of Italy after the fall of Buonaparte
was far more strictly a return to the old state of things
than the contemporary settlement of Germany. Italy
remained a geographical expression. Its states were, as
before, independent of one another.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>No tie between
the
Italian
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They were practically
dependent on a foreign power: but they were in
no way bound together, even by the laxest federal tie.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The princes
restored,
but not the
commonwealths.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The main principle of settlement was that the princes
who had lost their dominions should be restored, but
that the commonwealths which had been overthrown
should not be restored. Only harmless San Marino
was allowed to live on. Venice, Lucca, and Genoa
remained possessions of princes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Lombardy
and Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The sovereign of
Hungary and Austria, now calling himself ‘Emperor’
of his archduchy, carved out for himself an Italian
kingdom which bore the name of the <i>Kingdom of
Lombardy and Venice</i>. On the strength of this, the
Austrian, like his French predecessor, took upon him to
wear the Italian crown.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its extent.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The new kingdom consisted
of the former Italian possessions of Austria, the duchies
of Milan and Mantua, enlarged by the former possessions
of Venice, which had become Austrian at Campoformio.
The old boundary between Germany and
Italy was restored. Trent, Aquileia, Trieste, were
again severed from Italy. They remained possessions
of the same prince as Milan and Venice, but they
formed no part of his Lombardo-Venetian kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
On another frontier, where restoration would have had
to be made to a commonwealth, the arrangements
were less conservative, and the <i>Valtellina</i> remained
part of the new kingdom. The Ticino formed, as
before, the boundary towards Piedmont.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Genoa annexed
to
Piedmont.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The King
of Sardinia came again into possession of this last
country, enlarged by the former dominions of <i>Genoa</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Monaco.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This gave him the whole Ligurian seaboard, except
where the little principality of <i>Monaco</i> still went on.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tuscany,
Parma,
Modena,
Lucca.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Parma</i>, <i>Modena</i>, and <i>Tuscany</i> again became separate
duchies. <i>Lucca</i> remained a duchy alongside of them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lucca annexed
to
Tuscany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The family arrangements by which these states were
handed about to this and that widow do not concern
geography; all that need be marked is that, by virtue of
one of these compacts, Lucca was in the end added to
Tuscany. That grand-duchy was further increased by
the addition of the former outlying possessions of the
Sicilian crown, including Elba, the island which for a
moment was an Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Papal
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Pope came back to all
his old Italian possessions, outlying Benevento included.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Two
Sicilies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was formed again by
the restoration of the Kingdom of Naples to the
Bourbon king. Thus was formed the Italy of 1815,
an Italy which, save in the sweeping away of its commonwealths,
and the consequent extension of Sardinian
and Austrian territory, differed geographically but little
from the Italy of 1748. But in 1815 there were hopes
which had had no being in 1748. Italy was divided
on the map; but she had made up her mind to be one.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The union

<p>The union of Italy was at last to come from one of
those corners which in earlier history we have looked
on as being hardly Italian at all. It was not Milan or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
Florence or Rome which was to grow into the new
Italy. That function was reserved for a princely house
whose beginnings had been Burgundian rather than
Italian, whose chief territories had long lain on the Burgundian
side of the Alps, but which had gradually put
on an Italian character, and which had now become the
one national Italian dynasty. The Italian possessions of
the Savoyard house, Piedmont, Genoa, and the island of
Sardinia, now formed one of the chief Italian states, and
the only one whose rule, if still despotic, was not foreign.
Savoy, by ceasing to be Savoy, was to become Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements
of 1848.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The movements of 1848 in Italy, like those in Germany,
led to no lasting changes on the map: but they do so far
affect geography that new states were actually founded,
if only for a moment.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Momentary
commonwealths.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Rome, Venice, Milan, were actually
for a while republics, and the Two Sicilies were
for a while separated. In the next year all came back
as before. The next lasting change on the map was
that which at last restored a real Kingdom of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Campaign
of 1859.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The joint campaign of France and Sardinia won <i>Lombardy</i>
for the Sardinian kingdom. Lombardy was now
defined as that part of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom
which lay west of the Mincio, except that Mantua
was left out. She was left to Austria. A French
scheme for an Italian confederation came to nothing.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of

Rome, the so-called <i>Patrimony</i> and the <i>Campagna</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cession of
Savoy and
Nizza to
France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But France annexed the lands, strictly Burgundian
rather than Italian, of <i>Savoy</i> and <i>Nizza</i>. The Italian
kingdom was thus again called into being; but it had
not yet come to perfection. Italy had ceased to be
a geographical expression; but the Italian frontier still
presented some geographical anomalies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovery of

Italy to recover Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Part of the

The two great gaps in her
frontier were thus made good; but, to say nothing of the
annexations made by France, a large Italian-speaking
population, lying within the bounds of the old Italian
kingdom, still remains outside its modern revival. Trent,
Aquileia, Trieste, Istria, are still parts, not of an Italian
kingdom, not of a German kingdom, confederation, or empire,
but of an Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Otherwise
the Italian kingdom has formed itself, and it has taken its
place among the great powers of Europe. Yet the whole
peninsula does not form part of the Italian kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>San Marino

free.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Surrounded on every side by that kingdom, the commonwealth
of <i>San Marino</i>, like Rhodes or Byzantium
under the early Cæsars, still keeps its ancient freedom.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>The Kingdom of Burgundy.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
Burgundy
with Germany
and
Italy, 1032.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Burgundian Kingdom, which was united with
those of Germany and Italy after the death of its last
separate king Rudolf the Third, has had a fate unlike
that of any other part of Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dying out
of the kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its memory, as a
separate state, has gradually died out.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Chiefly
annexed by
France;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The greater part
of its territory has been swallowed up bit by bit by
a neighbouring power, and the small part which has
escaped that fate has long lost all trace of its original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
name or its original political relations. By a long series
of annexations, spreading over more than five hundred
years, the greater part of the kingdom has gradually
been incorporated with France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>part Italian;<br />
part Swiss.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of what remains, a
small corner forms part of the modern kingdom of Italy,
while the rest still keeps its independence in the form
of the commonwealths which make up the western
cantons of Switzerland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Burgundy
represented
by Switzerland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These cantons, in fact, are the
truest modern representatives of the Burgundian kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neutrality
of Switzerland
and
Belgium.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And it is on the Confederation of which they
form a part, interposed as it is between France, Italy,
the new German Empire, and the modern Austrian monarchy,
as a central state with a guaranteed neutrality,
that some trace of the old function of Burgundy, as the
middle kingdom, is thrown. This function it shares
with the Lotharingian lands at the other end of the
Empire, which now form part of the equally neutral
kingdom of Belgium, lands which, oddly enough, themselves
became Burgundian in another sense.</p>

<p>The Burgundian Kingdom, lying between the Alps,
the Saône and the Rhone, and the Mediterranean,
might be thought to have a fair natural boundary.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Boundaries
of the kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, while it kept any shadow of separate being, its
boundaries did not greatly change.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuation
of its
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They were however
somewhat fluctuating on the side of the Western
kingdom, being sometimes bounded by the Rhone and
sometimes reaching to the line of hills to the west of
it. They were also, as we have seen, somewhat fluctuating
on the side of Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Chiefly
Romance
speaking.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At this end the kingdom
took in some German-speaking districts; otherwise
the language was Romance, including several dialects
of the tongue of <i>Oc</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>County
Palatine. <br />
Lesser Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The northern part of the kingdom, answering to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
former Transjurane kingdom—the <i>Regnum Jurense</i>—formed
two chief states, the <i>County Palatine of Burgundy</i>—the
modern <i>Franche Comté</i>—and the <i>Lesser
Burgundy</i>, roughly taking in western Switzerland and
northern Savoy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Provence.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the Mediterranean lay the great
county of <i>Provence</i>, with a number of smaller counties
lying between it and the two northern principalities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Free
Cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the great characteristic of the land was that, next
to Italy, no part of Europe contained so many considerable
cities lying near together. Many of these at
different times strove more or less successfully after a
republican independence, and a few have kept it to our
own day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Little real
unity in the
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But, though the Burgundian kingdom might be
thought to have, on three sides at least, a good natural
frontier, it had but little real unity. The northern
part naturally clave to its connexion with the Empire
much longer than the southern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Burgundian
Palatinate.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>County
Palatine</i> of Burgundy often passed from one dynasty
to another, and it is remarkable for the number of
times that it was held as a separate state by several
of the great princes of Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Held by the
Emperor
Frederick,
1156-1189;<br />
by Philip of
France,
1315-1330.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was held by the
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in right of his wife; the
marriage of one of his female descendants carried it to
Philip the Fifth of France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>United with
the French
Duchy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then it became united
with the French duchy of Burgundy under the dukes
of the House of Valois.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1477.<br />
Held by the
House of
Austria,
Charles the
Fifth Count
of Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Saving a momentary French
occupation after the death of Charles the Bold, it
remained with them and their Austrian and Spanish
representatives.
Among these it had a second Imperial
Count in the person of Charles the Fifth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexed to
France,
1674.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But,
through all these changes of dynasty, it remained an
acknowledged fief of the Empire, till its annexation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
France under Lewis the Fourteenth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dole the
capital of
the county.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The capital of
this county, it must be remembered, was <i>Dole</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Besançon a
Free Imperial
city.
1189-1651.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
ecclesiastical metropolis of <i>Besançon</i>, though surrounded
by the county, remained a free city of the
Empire from the days of Frederick Barbarossa to those
of Ferdinand the Third.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>United to
France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was then merged in the
county, and along with the county it passed to France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Montbeilliard.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And it should be noticed that a small Burgundian land
in this quarter, the county of <i>Montbeilliard</i> or <i>Mümpelgard</i>,
first as a separate state, then in union with
the duchy of Württemberg, kept its allegiance to the
Empire till the wars of the French Revolution, when it
was annexed to France and was never restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Lesser
Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the Burgundian Palatinate thus kept its history
as an unit in European geography, the <i>Lesser Burgundy</i>
to the south-west of it had a different history. The
geography here gets somewhat confused through the fact
that this Lesser Burgundy, which in the twelfth century
passed under the power of the <i>Dukes of Zähringen</i> in
Swabia as <i>Rectors</i>, took in some districts which were
not parts of the Burgundian kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The eastern
part German.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The eastern
part of the kingdom itself was of German speech,
and its frontier towards the German duchy of Alemannia
or Swabia was somewhat fluctuating. The Aar
may be taken as the boundary of the kingdom, while
the Lesser Burgundy, as an administrative division,
stretched somewhat further to the East.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cities of the
Lesser Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus Basel, as
well the foundations of the House of Zähringen at Bern
and Freiburg, stood on strictly Burgundian ground,
while the city of Luzern and the land of Unterwalden
come under the head of the Lesser Burgundy, without
forming part of the Burgundian kingdom. These lands
long kept up their connexion with the Empire, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
the Lesser Burgundy did not long remain as a separate
unit.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dukes of
Zähringen.<br />
End of their
house, 1218.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
When the House of Zähringen came to an end,
the country began to split up into small principalities
and free cities which gradually grew into independent
commonwealths.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Break-up of
the duchy.<br />
Savoyard
territory.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The counts of Savoy, of
whom more presently, acquired a large territory on
both sides of the Lake of Geneva.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bishops,
Counts, and
Free Cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Other considerable
princes were the bishops of <i>Basel</i>, <i>Lausanne</i>, <i>Geneva</i>,
and <i>Sitten</i>, the counts of <i>Geneva</i>, <i>Kyburg</i>, <i>Gruyères</i>,
and <i>Neufchâtel</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Free
Lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Basel</i>, <i>Solothurn</i>, and <i>Bern</i> were Imperial
cities. The complicated relations between the
Bishops and the city of Geneva hindered that city from
having a strict right to that title. In Unterwalden and
in <i>Wallis</i>, notwithstanding the possessions and claims of
various spiritual and temporal lords, the most marked
feature was the retention of the old rural independence.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Old
League of
High Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of the cities in this region, Luzern, Bern, Freiburg,
Solothurn, and Basel, all gradually became members of
the <i>Old League of High Germany</i>, the ground-work of
the modern Swiss Confederation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Bern and
Freiburg
from Savoy,
1536.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Savoyard lands
north of the lake were conquered by Bern and Freiburg
in the sixteenth century, a conquest which also
secured the independence of Geneva.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Burgundian
cantons of
Switzerland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All these lands,
after going through the intermediate stage of allies or
subjects of some or other of the confederate cantons,
have in modern times become independent cantons
themselves. This process of annexation and liberation
will be traced more fully when we come to the history
of the Swiss Confederation.</p>

<p>To the south of this group of states, and partly
intermingled with them, lay another group, lying partly
within the Cisjurane and partly within the Transjurane
kingdom, which gradually grew into a great power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were the states which were united step by step
under the Counts of <i>Maurienne</i>, afterwards Counts of
<i>Savoy</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Burgundian
possession
of its
county.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
When their dominions were at their greatest
extent, they held south of the Lake of Geneva, besides
Maurienne and Savoy strictly so called, the districts
of <i>Aosta</i>, <i>Tarantaise</i>, the <i>Genevois</i>, <i>Chablais</i>, and <i>Faucigny</i>,
together with <i>Vaud</i> and <i>Gex</i> north of the lake.
Thus grew up the power of Savoy, which has already
been noticed in its purely Italian aspect, but which
must receive fuller separate treatment in a section
of its own.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>States between

and the Mediterranean.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The remainder of the Burgundian Kingdom consisted

Mediterranean.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bresse and

North of the Rhone lay the districts
of <i>Bresse</i> and <i>Bugey</i>, which passed at various times to
the House of Savoy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lyons,
Vienne,
Orange, &amp;c.<br />
Provence.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Southwards on the Rhone lay a
number of small states, among which the most important
in history are the archbishopric, the county, and the
free city of <i>Lyons</i>, the county or <i>Dauphiny</i> of <i>Vienne</i>
and the city of <i>Vienne</i>, the county or principality <i>of
Orange</i>, the city of <i>Avignon</i>, the county of <i>Venaissin</i>,
the free city of <i>Arles</i>, the capital of the kingdom, the free
city of <i>Massalia</i> or <i>Marseilles</i>, the county of <i>Nizza</i> or
<i>Nice</i>, and the great county or marquisate of <i>Provence</i>.
In this last power lay the first element of danger, especially
to the republican independence of the free cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes of
dynasty.<br />
The Angevins,
1246.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After being held by separate princes of its own, as well
as by the Aragonese kings, it passed by marriage into
the hands of a French prince, Charles of Anjou, the
conqueror of Sicily, and also the destroyer of the second
freedom of Massalia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growing

The possession of the greatest
member of the kingdom by a French ruler, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
made no immediate change in the formal state of things,
gave fresh strength to every tendency which tended to
withdraw the Burgundian lands from their allegiance
to the Empire and to bring them, first into connexion
with France, and then into actual incorporation with
the French kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Process of
French annexation.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">Step by step, though by a process which was spread
over many centuries, all the principalities and commonwealths
of the Burgundian kingdom, save the lands
which have been Swiss and the single valley which
is now Italian, have come into the hands of France.
The tendency shows itself early.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Avignon

Annexation
of Lyons,
1310.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Avignon</i> was seized
for a moment during the Albigensian wars;
but the
permanent process of French annexation began when
Philip the Fair took advantage of the disputes between
the archbishops and the citizens of <i>Lyons</i>, to join that
Imperial city to his dominions. The head of all the
Gauls, the seat of the Primate of all the Gauls, thus
passed into the hands of the new monarchy of Paris,
the first-fruits of French aggrandizement at the cost of
the Middle Kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Purchase of
the Dauphiny
of
Vienne,
1343.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Later in the same century, the
Dauphiny of <i>Vienne</i> was acquired by a bargain with its
last independent prince. This land also passed, through
the intermediate stage of an Imperial fief held by the
heir-apparent of the French crown, into a mere province
of France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The city of
Vienne
annexed,
1448.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the acquisition of the Dauphiny did not
carry with it that of the city of <i>Vienne</i>, which escaped
for more than a century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Valence,
1446.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Between the acquisition
of the Dauphiny and the acquisition of the city, the
county of <i>Valence</i> was annexed to the Dauphiny.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Provence,
1481.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Later
in the same century followed the great annexation of
<i>Provence</i> itself. The rule of French princes in that
county for two centuries had doubtless paved the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
for this annexation. And the acquisition of Provence
carried with it the acquisition of the cities of <i>Arles</i> and
<i>Marseilles</i>, which the counts of Provence had deprived
of their freedom. By this time the whole of the
land between the Rhone and the sea had been swallowed
up, save one state at the extreme south-east
corner of the kingdom, and a group of small states
which were now quite hemmed in by French territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nizza
passes to
Savoy, 1388.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first was the county of <i>Nizza</i> or Nice, which had
passed away from Provence to Savoy before the French
annexation of Provence. But by this time Savoy had
become an Italian power, and Nizza was from henceforth
looked on as Italian rather than Burgundian.
Between Provence and the Dauphiny lay the city of
<i>Avignon</i>, the county of <i>Venaissin</i>, and the principality
of <i>Orange</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Avignon

Avignon and Venaissin became papal possessions
by purchase from the sovereign of Provence; and,
though they were at last quite surrounded by French
territory, they remained papal possessions till they were
annexed in the course of the great Revolution. These
outlying possessions of the Popes perhaps did somewhat
towards preserving the independence of a more interesting
fragment of the ancient kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Orange.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This was
the Principality of <i>Orange</i>, which the neighbourhood
of the Pope hindered from being altogether surrounded
by French territory. This little state, whose name has
become so much more famous than itself, passed
through several dynasties, and for a long time it was
regularly seized by France in the course of every war.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its annexation
to
France,

But it was as regularly restored to independence at
every peace, and its final annexation did not happen till
the eighteenth century. The acquisition of Orange,
Avignon, and Venaissin, completed the process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
French aggrandizement in the lands between the
Rhone and the Var. The stages of the same process
as applied to the Savoyard lands will be best told in
another section.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Modern
states which
have split
off from the
three kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have thus traced the geographical history of
the three Imperial kingdoms themselves. It now follows
to trace in the like sort the origin and growth of
certain of the modern powers of Europe which have
grown out of one or more of those kingdoms. Certain
parts of the German, Italian, and Burgundian kingdoms
have split off from these kingdoms, so as to form
new political units, distinct from any of them. Five
states of no small importance in later European history
have thus been formed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their character
as
middle
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Most of them partake more
or less of the character of middle states, interposed
between France and one or more of the Imperial
kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Switzerland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
First, there is the Confederation of <i>Switzerland</i>,
which arose by certain German districts and
cities forming so close an union among themselves that
their common allegiance to the Empire gradually died
out. The Confederation grew into its present form by
the addition to these German districts of certain Italian
and Burgundian districts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Secondly, there are, or
rather were, the dominions of the Dukes of <i>Savoy</i>,
formed by the union of various Italian and Burgundian
districts. This however, as a middle power, has
ceased to exist; nearly all its Burgundian possessions
have been joined to France, while its Italian possessions
have grown into a new Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Dukes
of Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thirdly, there were the
dominions of the Dukes of <i>Burgundy</i>, forming a middle
power between France and Germany, and made up
by the union of French and Imperial fiefs.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Represented
by the
kingdoms
of the Low
Countries.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
represented on the modern maps by the kingdoms of
the <i>Netherlands</i> and <i>Belgium</i>, the greater part of both
of which belonged to the Burgundian dukes. Of these
kingdoms much the greater part had split off from the
old kingdom of Germany. Certain parts were once
French fiefs, but had ceased to be so.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recognized
neutrality
of Belgium,
Switzerland,
and
once of part
of Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The position of
three out of these four states as middle powers, and their
importance in that character, has been acknowledged
even by modern diplomacy in the neutrality which is
still guaranteed to Belgium and Switzerland, and which
was formerly extended to certain districts of Savoy.</p>

<p>Of these four states, Switzerland, Savoy, and the
duchy of Burgundy as represented by the two kingdoms
of the Low Countries, some have been merged
in other powers, and those which still remain count
only among the secondary states of Europe. But a
fifth power has also broken off from Germany which
still ranks among the greatest in Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Austrian
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This is the
power which, starting from a small German mark on
the Danube, has, by the gradual union of various lands,
German and non-German, grown into something distinct
from Germany, first under the name of the <i>Austrian ‘Empire’</i>
and more latterly under that of the <i>Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy</i>. This power differs from the other states
of which we have been just speaking, not only in its
vastly greater extent, but also in its position.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
the Austrian
dominion
as a
marchland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is
a marchland, a middle kingdom, but in a different
sense from Burgundy, Switzerland, Savoy, or Belgium.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
with the
western
marchlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All these were marchlands between Christian states,
between states all of which had formed part of the
Carolingian Empire. All lie on the western side
of the German and Italian kingdoms. Austria, on
the other hand, as its name implies, arose on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
eastern side of the German kingdom, as a mark against
Turanian and heathen invaders.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austria as

Magyar.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first mission of
Austria was to guard Germany against the Magyar.
When the Magyar was admitted into the fellowship of
Europe and Christendom—when, after a while, his realm
was united under a single sovereign with Austria—the
same duty was continued in another form.

the Turk.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The power
formed by the union of Hungary and Austria was one of
the chief among those which had to guard Christendom
against the Turk. Its history therefore forms one of
the connecting links between Eastern and Western Europe.
In this chapter it will be dealt with chiefly on its
Western side, with regard to its relations towards Germany
and Italy. The Eastern aspect of the Austro-Hungarian
power has more to do with the states which
arose out of the break up of the Eastern Empire.</p>

<p>These states then, Switzerland, Savoy, the Duchy
of Burgundy, the Netherlands, and Austria, form a
proper addition to the sections given to the three
Imperial kingdoms. I will now go on to deal with
them in order.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>The Swiss Confederation.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The original
Confederation
practically
German,<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>I have just spoken of the Swiss Confederation as
being in its origin purely German. This statement is
practically correct, as all the original cantons were German
in speech and feeling, and the formal style of their
union was <i>the Old League of High Germany</i>. But in strict
geographical accuracy there was, as we have seen in the
last section, a small Burgundian element in the Confederation,
if not from the beginning, at least from its aggrandizement
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>though part
of it geographically
Burgundian.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
That is to say, part of the territory of the states which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
formed the old Confederation lay geographically within
the kingdom of Burgundy, and a further part lay within
the Lesser Burgundy of the Dukes of Zähringen. But, by
the time when the history of the Confederation begins,
the kingdom of Burgundy was pretty well forgotten,
and the small German-speaking territory which it took
in at its extreme north-east corner may be looked on
as practically German ground.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>All the old
Cantons
German in
speech.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A more practical division
than the old boundaries of the kingdoms is the
boundary of the Teutonic and Romance speech; in
this sense all the cantons of the old Confederation, except
part of Freiburg, are German.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The later
Romance
Cantons.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Romance cantons
are those which were formed in modern times out of
the allied and subject states.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Many
popular
errors.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is specially needful to
bear in mind, first, that, till the last years of the thirteenth
century, not even the germ of modern Switzerland
had appeared on the map of Europe; secondly,
that the Confederation did not formally become an
independent power till the seventeenth century; lastly,
that, though the <i>Swiss</i> name had been in common use
for ages, it did not become the formal style of the
Confederation till the nineteenth century. Nothing in
the whole study of historical geography is more necessary
than to root out the notion that there has always
been a country of Switzerland, as there has always been
a country of Germany, Gaul, or Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Swiss
do not represent
the
Helvetii.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And it is no
less needful to root out the notion that the Swiss of
the original cantons in any way represent the Helvetii
of Cæsar.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Summary
of Swiss
history.<br />
A German
League
having become
more
united and
independent
than
others,
annexes Romance
allies
and subjects.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The points to be borne in mind are that
the Swiss Confederation is simply one of many German
Leagues, which was more lasting and became more
closely united than other German Leagues—that it
gradually split off from the German Kingdom—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
in the course of this process, the League and its members
obtained a large body of Italian and Burgundian
allies and subjects—lastly, that these allies and subjects
have in modern times been joined into one Federal
body with the original German Confederates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Three
Lands on
the boundary
of the
three kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The three Swabian lands which formed the kernel
of the Old League lay at the point of union of the
three Imperial kingdoms, parts of all of which were to
become members of the Confederation in its later form.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>First known
document of
union, 1291.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first known document of confederation between the
three lands dates from the last years of the thirteenth
century. But that document is likely to have been
rather the confirmation than the actual beginning of
their union. They had for their neighbours several
ecclesiastical and temporal lords, some other Imperial
lands and towns, and far greater than all, the Counts
of the house of <i>Kyburg</i> and <i>Habsburg</i>, who had
lately grown into the more dangerous character of
Dukes of Austria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
the League.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Confederation grew for a while
by the admission of neighbouring lands and cities
as members of a free German Confederation, owning
no superior but the Emperor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luzern,
1332.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
First of all, the city
of <i>Luzern</i> joined the League.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Zürich,
1351.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then came the Imperial
city of <i>Zürich</i>, which had already begun to form
a little dominion in the adjoining lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Glarus and
Zug, 1352.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then came
the land of <i>Glarus</i> and the town of <i>Zug</i> with its small
territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bern, 1353.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And lastly came the great city of <i>Bern</i>,
which had already won a dominion over a considerable
body of detached and outlying allies and subjects.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eight
Ancient
Cantons.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These confederate lands and towns formed the <i>Eight
Ancient Cantons</i>. Their close alliance with each other
helped the growth of each canton separately, as well as
that of the League as a whole.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their
growth.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Those cantons whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
geographical position allowed them to do so, were
thus able to extend their power, in the form of various
shades of dominion and alliance, over the smaller
lands and towns in their neighbourhood. These lesser
changes and annexations cannot all be recorded here;
but it must be carefully borne in mind that the process
was constantly going on.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dominion
of Zürich
and Bern.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Zürich, and yet more
Bern, each formed, after the manner of an ancient
Greek city, what in ancient Greece would have passed
for an empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
from Austria,
1415-1460.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the fifteenth century, large conquests
were made at the expense of the House of
Austria, of which the earlier ones were made by
direct Imperial sanction. The Confederation, or some
or other of its members, had now extended its territory
to the Rhine and the Lake of Constanz.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Aargau,
Thurgau,
&amp;c.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
lands thus won, <i>Aargau</i>, <i>Thurgau</i>, and some other
districts, were held as subject territories in the hands
of some or other of the Confederate states.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>No new canton
formed
for a long
time.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It is a fact to be specially noticed in the history of
the Confederation, that, for nearly a hundred and thirty
years, though the territory and the power of the Confederation
were constantly increasing, no new states were
admitted to the rank of confederate cantons. Before
the next group of cantons was admitted, the general
state of the Confederation and its European position
had greatly changed. It had ceased to be a purely
German power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning
of Italian
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first extension beyond the original
German lands and those Burgundian lands which were
practically German began in the direction of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Uri obtains
Val Levantina,
1441.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Uri
had, by the annexation of Urseren, become the neighbour
of the Duchy of Milan, and in the middle of the
fifteenth century, this canton acquired some rights in
the <i>Val Levantina</i> on the Italian side of the Alps. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
was the beginning of the extension of the Confederation
on Italian ground. But far more important than this was
the advance of the Confederates over the Burgundian
lands to the west.<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>First
Savoyard
conquest of
Bern.<br />
1475.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The war with Charles of Burgundy
enabled Bern to win several detached possessions in the
Savoyard lands north and east of the lake, and even on
the lower course of the Rhone.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Savoyard
conquests
of Freiburg
and Wallis.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, while Bern advanced,
some points in the same direction were gained
by her allies who are not yet members of the Confederation,
by the city of <i>Freiburg</i> and the League of <i>Wallis</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
Wallis.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last confederation had grown up on the upper
course of the Rhone, where the small free lands had
gradually displaced the territorial lords.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Freiburg
and Solothurn
become
Cantons,
1481.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Soon after this
came the next admission of new cantons, those of the
cities of <i>Freiburg</i> and <i>Solothurn</i>, each of them bringing
with it its small following of allied and subject territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Basel and
Schaffhausen,
1501.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Twenty years later, <i>Basel</i> and <i>Schaffhausen</i>, the latter
being the only canton north of the Rhine, were admitted
with their following of the like kind.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Appenzell,
1513.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Twelve years later,
<i>Appenzell</i>, a little land which had set itself free from
the rule of the abbots of <i>Saint Gallen</i>, after having
long been in alliance with the Confederates, was admitted
to the rank of a canton.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Thirteen
Cantons,
1513-1798.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus was made up
the full number of Thirteen Cantons, which remained
unchanged down to the wars of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>But the time when the Confederation was finally
settled as regards the number of cantons was also a
time of great extension of territory on the part both
of the Confederation and of several of its members.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Graubünden.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the south-east corner of the Confederate territory,
on the borders of the duchy of Milan and the county
of Tyrol, the League of <i>Graubünden</i> or the <i>Grey
Leagues</i> had gradually arisen. A number of communities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
as in Wallis, had got rid of the neighbouring
lords, and had formed themselves into three leagues,
the <i>Grey League</i> proper, the <i>Gotteshausbund</i>, and the
League of <i>Ten Jurisdictions</i>, which three were again
united by a further federal tie.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their alliance
with
the Confederates.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of the
fifteenth century, the Leagues so formed entered into
an alliance with the Confederates.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1495-1567.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then began a great
accession of territory towards the south on the part
both of the Confederates and of their new allies.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Italian dominion
of
the Confederation,
1512;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Confederates received a considerable territory within
the duchy of Milan, including <i>Bellinzona</i>, <i>Locarno</i>, and
<i>Lugano</i>, as the reward of services done to the House
of Sforza.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of the Grey
Leagues,
1513.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The next year their new allies of the Grey
Leagues also won some Italian territory, the <i>Valtellina</i>
and the districts of <i>Chiavenna</i> and <i>Bormio</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Early
Savoyard
conquests of
Bern, Freiburg,
and
Wallis,
1536.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Next came
the conquest of a large part of the Savoyard lands, of
all north of the Lake and a good deal to the south, by
the arms of Bern, Freiburg, and Wallis.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Vaud.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Bern and
Freiburg divided <i>Vaud</i> in very unequal proportions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lausanne.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Bern and Wallis divided <i>Chablais</i> on the south side of
the lake, and Bern annexed the bishopric of <i>Lausanne</i>
on the north.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geneva in
alliance
with Bern
and Freiburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Geneva</i>, the ally of Bern and Freiburg,
with her little territory of detached scraps, was now
surrounded by the dominion of her most powerful
allies at Bern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Territory
restored to
Savoy, 1567.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But by a later treaty Bern and Wallis
gave back to Savoy all that they had won south of the
Lake, with the territory of <i>Gex</i> to the west of it.
Geneva thus again had Savoy for a neighbour, a neighbour
at whose expense she even made some conquests—Gex
among them—conquests which the French ally
of the free city would not allow her to keep. Later
changes gave her a neighbour yet more dangerous
than Savoy in the shape of France itself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gruyères

Before these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
changes, Bern and Freiburg divided the county of <i>Gruyères</i>
between them, the last important instance of that
kind of process.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Allies.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Confederation was thus fully formed, with its
Thirteen Cantons and their allied states.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saint
Gallen.<br />
Bienne.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of these the
<i>Abbot of Saint Gallen</i>, the <i>town of Saint Gallen</i>, and
the town of <i>Biel</i> or <i>Bienne</i>, were so closely allied with
the Confederates as to have a place in their Diets.
Besides relations of less close alliance which the Confederates
had with various Alsatian cities, several other
states had a connexion so close and lasting with the
Confederation or with some of its members, as to form
part of the same political system.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><i>Bischofbasel.</i><br />
Mühlhausen
and

Such were the
Leagues of Wallis and Graubünden, the Bishop of
<i>Basel</i>, the outlying town of <i>Mühlhausen</i> in Elsass, and
for a while that of <i>Rottweil</i>. Bern too, and sometimes
other cantons, had relations both with the town and
with the princes of <i>Neufchâtel</i>, which, after passing
through several dynasties, was at last inherited by the
Kings of Prussia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Constanz.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Constanz</i>, at the other end of the
Confederate land, was refused admission as a canton, but
for a while it was in alliance with some of the cantons.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Passes to
Austria,

But this connexion was severed when Constanz, instead

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Confederation

from the

The power thus formed, a power in which a
body of German Confederates was surrounded by a
body of allies and subjects, German, Italian, and Burgundian,
all of them originally members of the Empire,
was by the Peace of Westfalia formally released from
all allegiance to the Empire and its chief.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Date of the
practical

Their practical
separation may be dated much earlier, from the

<p class="pb2">The growth of the League into an independent
power was doubtless greatly promoted by its geographical
position, as occupying the natural citadel of
Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its anomalous
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the piecemeal way in which it grew up
was marked by the anomalous nature of its frontier on
several points. On the north the Rhine would seem
to be a natural boundary, but Schaffhausen beyond
the Rhine formed part of the Confederation, while
Constanz and other points within it did not. To the
south the possession of territory on the Italian side
of the Alps seems an anomaly, an anomaly which is
brought out more strongly by a singularly irregular
and arbitrary frontier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Confederation

state.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But looking on the Confederation
as the middle state, arising at the point of junction

fitting that it should spread itself into all three.</p>

was destroyed.

The Federal system was abolished;
instead of the Old League of High Germany, there
arose, after the new fashion of nomenclature, a <i>Helvetic
Republic</i>, in which the word <i>canton</i> meant no more
than <i>department</i>. Yet even by such a revolution as
this some good was done.

the surrender of all rights over Neufchâtel by the

<h3>§ 7. <i>The State of Savoy.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position
and growth
of Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The growth of the power of Savoy, the border state
of Burgundy and Italy, has necessarily been spoken of
more than once in earlier sections; but it seems needful
to give a short connected account of its progress, and to
mark the way in which a power originally Burgundian
gradually lost on the side of Burgundy and grew on
the side of Italy, till it has in the end itself grown
into a new Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geographical
position
of the
Savoyard
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The lands which have at different
times passed under the rule of the House of Savoy
lie continuously, though with an irregular frontier, and
though divided by the great barrier of the Alps.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their three
divisions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They
fall however into three main geographical divisions,
which at one time became also political divisions,
being held by different branches of the Savoyard
House.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Italian.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There are the Italian possessions of that House,
which have grown into the modern Italian kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Burgundian
south
of the lake.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There are the more strictly Savoyard lands south of the
Lake of Geneva, and the other lands south of the
Rhone after it issues from that lake, all of which have
passed away under the power of France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Burgundian
north
of the lake.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And there
are the lands north of the Lake and of the Rhone, part
of which have also become French, while others have
become part of the Swiss Confederation. Both these
last lay within the kingdom of Burgundy, and stretched
into both its divisions, Transjurane and Cisjurane. In
no part of our story is it more necessary to avoid
language which forestalls the arrangements of later
times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Popular
confusions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A wholly false impression is given by the use
of language such as commonly is used. We often
hear of the princes of Savoy holding lands ‘in France’
and ‘in Switzerland. They held lands which by virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
of later changes have severally become French and
Swiss; but those lands became French and Swiss only
by ceasing to be Savoyard. On the other hand, to
speak of them from the beginning as holding lands in
Italy is perfectly accurate. The Savoyard states were
a large and fluctuating assemblage of lands on both
sides of the Alps, lying partly within the Italian and
partly within the Burgundian kingdom. These last
have shared the fate of the other fiefs of that crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Savoyard
state
originally
Burgundian.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The cradle of the Savoyard power lay in the Burgundian
lands immediately bordering upon Italy and
stretching on both sides of the Alps. It was to their
geographical position, as holding several great mountain
passes, that the Savoyard princes owed their first importance,
succeeding therein in some measure to the
Burgundian kings themselves.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The early stages of
the growth of the house are very obscure; and its
power does not seem to have formed itself till after
the union of Burgundy with the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Possessions
of the
Counts of
Maurienne.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it seems
plain that, at the end of the eleventh century, the
Counts of <i>Maurienne</i>, which was their earliest title,
held rights of sovereignty in the Burgundian districts
of <i>Maurienne</i>, <i>Savoy</i> strictly so called, <i>Tarantaise</i>,
and <i>Aosta</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Aosta; its
special
position.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last valley and city, though
on the Italian side of the Alps, had hitherto been
rather Burgundian than Italian.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Its allegiance had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
fluctuated several times between the two kingdoms; but,
from the time that Savoy held lands in both, the question
became of no practical importance. And, without
entering into minute questions of tenure, it may be
said that the early Savoyard possessions reached to the
Lake of Geneva, and spread on both sides of the inland
mouth of the Rhone. The power of the Savoyard princes
in this region was largely due to their ecclesiastical position
as advocates of the abbey of Saint Maurice.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geographical
character
of the
Burgundian
territories.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus
their possessions had a most irregular outline, nearly surrounding
the lands of <i>Genevois</i> and <i>Faucigny</i>. A state
of this shape, like Prussia in a later age and on a greater
scale, was, as it were, predestined to make further
advances. But for some centuries those advances were
made much more largely in Burgundy than in Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their early
Italian possessions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The original Italian possessions of the House bordered
on their Burgundian counties of Maurienne and Aosta,
taking in <i>Susa</i> and <i>Turin</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marquesses
in Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This small marchland gave
its princes the sounding title of <i>Marquesses in Italy</i>.
The endless shiftings of territory in this quarter could
be dealt with only at extreme length, and they are
matters of purely local concern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations
of
dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In truth, they are
not always fluctuations of territory in any strict sense
at all, but rather fluctuations of rights between the
feudal princes, the cities, and their bishops.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their position
in the
twelfth and thirteenth
centuries.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the princes of Savoy
were still hemmed in in their own corner of Italy by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
princes of equal or greater power, at <i>Montferrat</i>, at
<i>Saluzzo</i>, at <i>Iverea</i>, and at <i>Biandrate</i>. And it must be
remembered that their position as princes at once
Burgundian and Italian was not peculiar to them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Other
princes at
once Italian
and
Burgundian.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Dauphins of the Viennois and the Counts of Provence
both held at different times territories on the Italian
side of the Alps. The Italian dominions of the family
remained for a long while quite secondary to its Burgundian
possessions, and the latter may therefore be
traced out first.</p>

But the final incorporation of those

Lake.

Soon after, through
the conquests of Peter of Savoy, who was known as the
Little Charlemagne and who plays a part in English as
well as in Burgundian history, these possessions grew
into a large dominion, stretching along a great part of
the shores of the Lake of Neufchâtel and reaching as
far north as <i>Murten</i> or <i>Morat</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1239-1268.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it was a straggling,
and in some parts fragmentary, dominion, the continuity
of which was broken by the scattered possessions of the
Bishops of Lausanne and other ecclesiastical and temporal
lords. This extension of dominion brought Peter
into close connexion with the lands and cities which
were afterwards to form the Old League of High Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>His relations with

Bern especially, the power to which his conquests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>

as a protector.

This new dominion north of the Lake
was, after Peter’s reign, held for a short time by a
separate branch of the Savoyard princes as <i>Barons of
Vaud</i>; but in the middle of the fourteenth century,
their barony came into the direct possession of the elder
branch of the house. The lands of Faucigny and the
Genevois were thus altogether surrounded by the Savoyard
territory.

Savoyard possessions within the Dauphiny.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The

The long
struggle for the Genevois, the <i>county</i> of Geneva, was
ended by its purchase in the beginning of the fifteenth
century. This left the <i>city</i> of Geneva altogether surrounded
by Savoyard territory, a position which before
long altogether changed the relations between the
Savoyard counts and the city.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changed

Geneva.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Hitherto, in the endless
struggles between the Genevese counts, bishops, and
citizens, the Savoyard counts, the enemies of the immediate
enemy, had often been looked on by the citizens
as friends and protectors. Now that they had
become immediate neighbours of the city, they began
before long to be its most dangerous enemies.

The

the famous Amadeus the Eighth, the first Duke of
Savoy, who received that rank by grant of King Siegmund,
and who was afterwards the Antipope Felix.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greatest

In his reign the dominions of Savoy, as a power ruling
on both sides of the Alps, reached their greatest extent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
But the Savoyard power was still pre-eminently
Burgundian, and Chambery was its capital. The continuous
Burgundian dominion of the house now reached
from the Alps to the Saône, surrounding the lake of
Geneva and spreading on both sides of the lake of
Neufchâtel.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation

1388.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides this continuous Burgundian dominion,
the House of Savoy had already become possessed
of <i>Nizza</i>, by which their dominions reached to the sea.
This last territory had however, though technically Burgundian,
geographically more to do with the Italian
possessions of the house.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Savoy

But this great extension of
territory brought Savoy on its western side into closer
connexion with the most dangerous of neighbours.
Her frontier for a certain distance joined the actual
kingdom of France. The rest joined the Dauphiny,
which was now practically French, and the county
of Provence, which was ruled by French princes and
which before the end of the century became an actual
French possession.

Through
the working of these two causes, all that the House
of Savoy now keeps of this great Burgundian territory
is the single city and valley of Aosta. After
the fifteenth century, the Burgundian history of that
house consists of the steps spread over more than
three hundred years by which this great dominion was
lost.</p>

During the eleventh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
twelfth centuries, partly through the growth of the cities,
partly through the enmity of the Emperor Henry
the Sixth, the dominions of the Savoyard princes as
marquesses of Susa had been cut short, so as hardly
to reach beyond their immediate Alpine valleys.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grants to
Count
Thomas.

In
the beginning of the thirteenth century, when Count
Thomas obtained his first royal grant north of the
lake, he also obtained grants of <i>Chieri</i> and other
places in the neighbourhood of Turin. These grants
were merely nominal; but they were none the less
the beginning of the Italian advance of the house.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>First

Later in the thirteenth

also, and thus brought the house of Savoy into a
dangerous neighbourhood with French princes on its
Italian as well as on its Burgundian side. Through
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Savoyard
border went on extending itself. But the Italian possessions
of the house, like its possessions north of the
lake, were separated from the main body of Savoyard
territory to form a fief for one of the younger
branches.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Counts of

During the fourteenth

<i>Saluzzo</i>, lying between the old inheritance

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
the Italian
wars.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the course of the next century and a half the
Savoyard state altogether changed its character in
many ways. The changes which affected all Europe,
especially the great Italian wars, could not fail greatly
to affect the border state of Italy and Gaul. And there
is no part of our story which gives us more instructive
lessons with regard to the proper limits of our subject.
During this time the Savoyard power was brought
under a number of influences, all of which deeply
affected its history, but which did not all alike affect its
geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>French influence
and
occupation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We have a period of French influence, a
period of French occupation, and more than one actual
fresh settlement of the frontier. Mere influence does not
concern us at all. Occupation concerns us only when
it takes the form of permanent conquest. An occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
of nearly forty years comes very near to permanent
conquest; still when, as in this case, it comes to an end
without having effected any formal annexation, it is
hardly to be looked on as actually working a change
on the map.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Occupation
by France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
France occupied Piedmont for nearly
as long a time as Bern occupied the lands south of the
lake. Yet we look on the one occupation as simply
part of the military history, while in the other we see
a real, though only temporary, geographical change.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Increased
Italian
character
of Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the result alike of influence, of occupation, and of
actual change of boundaries, all tended the same way.
They all tended to strengthen the Italian character of
the House of Savoy, to cut short its Burgundian
possessions, and, if not greatly to increase its Italian
possessions, at least to put it in the way of greatly
increasing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Decline of
Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During the second half of the fifteenth century, the
power of the House of Savoy greatly declined, partly
through the growing influence of France, partly through
the division, in the form of appanages, of the lands
which had been so lately formed together into a
compact state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Italian
wars.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then came the Italian wars, in which
the Savoyard dominions became the highway for the
kings of France in their invasions of Italy. The strictly
territorial changes of this period chiefly concern the
marquisate of Saluzzo on the Italian side and the
northern frontier on the Burgundian side. In the end
these two points of controversy were merged in a single
settlement.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>First loss of
lands north
of the lake.
1475.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first loss of territory on the northern
frontier, the first sign that the Savoyard power in
Burgundy was gradually to fall back, was the loss of
part of the lands north of the lake in the war between
Charles of Burgundy and the Confederates. <i>Granson</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
on the lake of Neufchâtel, <i>Murten</i> or <i>Morat</i> on its own
lake, <i>Aigle</i> at the south-east end of the great lake,
<i>Échallens</i> lying detached in the heart of Vaud, all
passed away from Savoy and became for ever Confederate
ground. Sixty years later, the affairs of Geneva
led to the great intervention of Bern, Freiburg and
Wallis, by which Savoy was for ever shorn of her
possessions north of the lake.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of the
lands on
both sides
of the lake.
1536.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
For a while indeed
she was cut off from the lake altogether; Chablais
passed away as well as Vaud. Geneva, with her detached
scraps of territory, was now wholly surrounded
by her own allies.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reunion of
the lands
south of the
lake.
1567.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thirty years later, Bern restored
all her conquests south of the lake, together with Gex
to the west, leaving Geneva again surrounded by the
dominions of Savoy. Wallis too gave up part of her
share, keeping only the narrow strip on the left bank
of the Rhone.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Charles the
Good.
1504-1553.<br />
Emanuel
Filibert.
1553-1580.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The loss and the recovery mark the
difference between the reigns of Duke Charles the
Third, called the Good, and Duke Emmanuel Filibert
with the Iron Head. The difference of the two reigns
is equally marked with regard to France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning
of French
occupation
1536.<br />
Its end.
1574.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Almost at
the same moment as the conquests made by Bern, began
that occupation, whole or partial, of Savoyard territory
by the French arms which did not come wholly to an
end for thirty-eight years. Savoy then appeared again
as a power whose main strength lay in Italy, whose
capital, instead of Burgundian Chambery, was Italian
Turin. And all later changes of frontier and the
changes of frontier in her more southern dominions
also tended the same way to increase the Italian character
of the Savoyard power, and to lessen its extent
in the lands which we may distinguish as Transalpine,
for the Burgundian name has now altogether passed
away from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span></p>

<p class="pb2">The first formal exchange of Burgundian for Italian
ground happened under Emmanuel Filibert, shortly after
the emancipation of his dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisition
of Tenda.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The small county
of <i>Tenda</i> was acquired in exchange for the marquisate
of <i>Villars</i> in Bresse. This extended the Italian frontier,
without formally narrowing the Burgundian frontier;
still it was a step in the direction of more important
changes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Disputes
about the
homage of
Saluzzo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first of these was caused by the endless
disputes which arose out of the disputed homage
of Saluzzo.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation
of
Saluzzo by
France.
1548.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Marquesses of Saluzzo preferred the
French claimant of their homage to the Savoyard, a
preference which led in the end to definite annexation
by France. This was the first acquisition of Italian
soil by France as such, as distinguished from the claims
of French princes over Milan, Naples, and Asti. France
thus threw a continuous piece of French territory into
the heart of the states of Savoy. When the French
occupation ceased, Saluzzo still remained to France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
Saluzzo.

Presently it was conquered by Duke Charles Emmanuel.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reign of
Charles
Emanuel.
1580-1630.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The reign of this prince marks the final change
in the destiny of the house of Savoy. He himself had
dreamed of wider conquests on the Gaulish side of the
Alps than had ever presented himself to any prince of
his house. He was to be Count of Provence, King
of Burgundy, perhaps King of France. The real
results of his reign told in exactly the opposite way.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bresse, &amp;c.

for Saluzzo.
1601.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By the treaty which ended his war with France,
Saluzzo was ceded to Savoy in exchange for <i>Bresse</i>,
<i>Bugey</i>, <i>Valromey</i>, and <i>Gex</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of position
beyond
the Alps.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A powerful neighbour
was thus shut out from a possession which cut the
Savoyard states in twain; but the price at which this
advantage was gained amounted to a final surrender
of the old position of the Savoyard House beyond the
Alps. The Rhone and not the Saône became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
boundary, while the surrender of Gex brought France
to the shores of the Lake. Geneva, her city and her
scattered scraps of territory, had now, besides Bern,
two other neighbours in France and Savoy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Attempts
on Geneva.
1602-1609.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The two attempts
of Charles Emmanuel to seize upon the city were
fruitless. Savoy now became distinctly an Italian power,
keeping indeed the lands between the Alps and the
Lake, the proper Duchy of Savoy, but having her main
possessions and her main interests in Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Later

We may
here therefore finish the history of the Transalpine possessions

Lastly, as all
the world knows, Savoy itself, including the guaranteed
neutral lands on the Lake, passed, along with Nizza, to
France. Savoy itself was so far favoured as to be
allowed to keep its ancient name, and to form the departments
of <i>High</i> and <i>Low Savoy</i>, instead of being
condemned, as in the former temporary annexation, to
bear the names of <i>Leman</i> and <i>Mont Blanc</i>. The Burgundian
Counts who have grown into Italian Kings
have thus lost the land under whose name their House
grew famous.

Though
the Savoyard possessions in Italy were presently increased

a poor compensation for the French occupation of

which lasted till nearly the end of the century.

The

Milanese duchy, the acquisition and exchange of the
two island kingdoms, the last annexation by France,
the acquisition of the Genoese seaboard, the growth of
the Kingdom of Sardinia into the Kingdom of Italy,
have been already told. Our present business has been
with Savoy as a middle power, a character which
practically passed from it with the loss of Vaud and
Bresse, and all traces of which are now sunk in the
higher but less interesting character of one of the great
powers of Europe. From Savoy in its character of a
middle power, as one of the representatives of ancient
Burgundy, we naturally pass to another middle power
which prolonged the existence of the Burgundian
name, and on part of which, though not on a part
lying within its Burgundian possessions, some trace of
the ancient functions of the middle kingdom is still
laid by the needs of modern European policy.</p>


<h3>§ 8. <i>The Duchy of Burgundy and the Low Countries.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
the Valois
Dukes of Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Among all the powers which we have marked as
having for their special characteristic that of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
middle states, the one which came most nearly to an
actual revival of the middle states of earlier days was
the Duchy of Burgundy under the Valois Dukes. A
great power was formed whose princes held no part of
their dominions in wholly independent sovereignty.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their twofold
vassalage.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In
practical power they were the peers of their Imperial and
royal neighbours; but their formal character throughout
every rood of their possessions was that of vassals of one
or other of those neighbours.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its effects.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Such a twofold vassalage
naturally suggested, even more strongly than vassalage
to a single lord could have done, the thought of emancipation
from all vassalage, and of the gathering together
of endless separate fiefs into a single kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Schemes
for a Burgundian
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The gradual acquisitions of earlier princes, especially
those of Philip the Good, naturally led up to the design,
avowed by his son Charles the Bold, of exchanging the
title of Duke for that of King. The memories of the older
Burgundian and Lotharingian kingdoms had no doubt a
share in shaping the schemes of a prince who possessed
so large a share of the provinces which had formed
those kingdoms. The schemes of Charles, one can
hardly doubt, reached to the formation of a realm like
that of the first Lothar, a realm stretching from the
Ocean to the Mediterranean. His actual possessions, at
their greatest extent, formed a power to which Burgundy
gave its name, but which was historically at least
as much Lotharingian as Burgundian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Historical
importance
of the Burgundian
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And though
this actual dominion was only momentary, no power
ever arose which fills a wider and more œcumenical
place in history than the line of the Valois Dukes.
Their power connects the earliest settlement of the
European states with the latest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1870.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It spans a thousand
years, and connects the division of Verdun with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
last treaty that guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium.
The growth of their power was directly influenced by
memories of the early Carolingian partitions; and, even
in its fall, it has itself influenced the geography and
politics of Europe ever since. As a Burgundian power,
it was as ephemeral as all other Burgundian powers have
ever been. As a Lotharingian power, it abides still
in its effects.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>History of
the Low
Countries.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The union of the greater part of the Low
Countries under a single prince, and that a prince who
was on the whole foreign to the Empire, strengthened
that tendency to split off from the Empire which was
already at work in some of those lands. Later events
caused them to split off in two bodies instead of one. This
last tendency became so strong that a modern attempt
to unite them broke down, and their place in the modern
polity of Europe is that of two distinct kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Final result
of the
Burgundian
dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
existence of those two kingdoms is the final result of the
growth of the Burgundian power in the fifteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its effect
on language.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And by leading to the separation of the northern
Netherlands from the Empire, it has led to one result
which could never have been reckoned on, the preservation
of one branch of the Low-Dutch tongue as the
acknowledged and literary speech of an independent
nation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Netherlands
and
Belgium.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its political results were the creation, in the
shape of the northern Netherlands, of a power which
once held a great place in the affairs of Europe and of
the world, and the slower growth, in the shape of
the southern Netherlands, of a state in which modern
European policy still acknowledges the character of a
middle kingdom. As the neutral confederation of
Switzerland represents the middle kingdom of Burgundy,
so the neutral kingdom of Belgium represents
the middle kingdom of Lotharingia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ducal Burgundy

Kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Duchy of Burgundy which gave its name to
the Burgundian power of the fifteenth century was that
one among the many lands bearing the Burgundian
name which lay wholly outside the Burgundian kingdom
of the Emperors. This Burgundy, the only one
which has kept the name to our own time, the duchy
of which Dijon is the capital, never was a fief of the
Eastern Kingdom or of the Empire, after the final
separation. It always acknowledged the supremacy of
the kings of Laon and Paris.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Two lines
of Dukes.
1032.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By these last the duchy
was twice granted in fief to princes of their own house,
once in the eleventh century and once in the fourteenth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Valois.

This last grant was the beginning of the Dukes of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
Flanders
and Burgundy.
1369.<br />
The county
of Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Philip the Hardy, the first Duke of
this line, obtained, by his marriage with Margaret of
Flanders, the counties of <i>Flanders</i>, <i>Artois</i>, <i>Rhetel</i>, and
<i>Nevers</i>, all fiefs of the crown of France, together with
the <i>County Palatine of Burgundy</i> as a fief of the Empire.
The peculiar position of the Dukes of Burgundy of this
line was at once established by this marriage.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Two masses
of territory.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Duke
Philip held of two lords, and his dominions lay in two
distinct masses. The two Burgundies, duchy and county,
and the county of Nevers, lay geographically together;
Flanders and Artois lay together at a great distance;
the small possession of Rhetel lay again detached
between the two. Any princes who held such a territory
as this could hardly fail to devote their main
policy to the work of bringing about the geographical
union of their scattered possessions. Nor was this all.
The possession of the two Burgundies made their
common sovereign a vassal at once of France and of
the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
the Netherlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The possession of Flanders, Artois, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
Rhetel further brought him into connexion with those
border lands of the Empire and of the French kingdom
where the authority of either over-lord was weakest,
and which had long been tending to form themselves
into a separate political system distinct from both. The
results of this complicated position, as worked out,
whether by the prudence of Philip the Good or by the
daring of Charles the Bold, form the history of the
Dukes of Burgundy of the House of Valois.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Imperial
and French
fiefs in the
Netherlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The lands which we are accustomed to group
together under the name of the <i>Netherlands</i> or <i>Low
Countries</i> lay chiefly within the bounds of the Empire;
but the county of Flanders had always been a fief of
France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fief of the
Counts of
Flanders

Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Part however of the dominions of its counts,
the north-eastern corner of their dominions, the lands
of <i>Alost</i> and <i>Waas</i>, were held of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Zealand.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These
lands, together with the neighbouring islands of <i>Zealand</i>,
formed a ground of endless disputes between the
Counts of Flanders and their northern neighbours the
Counts of <i>Holland</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Holland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last county gradually disentangles
itself from the general mass of the Frisian lands
which lie along the whole coast from the mouth of the
Scheld to the mouth of the Weser.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Inroads of

And those great inroads
of the sea in the thirteenth century which gave the
Zuyder-Zee its present extent helped to give the country
a natural boundary, and to part it off from the Frisian
lands to the north-east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Disputes
with the
free Frisians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Towards the end of the thirteenth
century Friesland west of the Zuyder-Zee had
become part of the dominions of the Counts.

West Friesland.
1417-1447.<br />
County of
East Friesland.
1454.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The land
immediately east of the gulf established its freedom,
while <i>East Friesland</i> passed to a line of counts, under
whom its fortunes parted off from those of the Netherlands.
Part of its later history has been already given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
in the character of a more purely German state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Bishops of
Utrecht.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Both
the counts and the free Frisians had also dangerous
neighbours in the Bishops of <i>Utrecht</i>, the great ecclesiastical
princes of this region, who held a large temporal
sovereignty lying apart from their city on the eastern
side of the gulf. These disputes went on, as also
disputes with the Dukes of Geldern, without any final
settlement, almost to the time when all these lands
began to be united under the Burgundian power. But
before this time, the Counts of Holland had become
closely connected with lands much further to the south.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Brabant.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Among a number of states in this region, the most
powerful was the Duchy of <i>Brabant</i>, which represented
the Duchy of the Lower Lotharingia, and whose princes
held the mark of <i>Antwerp</i> and the cities of <i>Brussels</i>,
<i>Löwen</i> or <i>Louvain</i>, and <i>Mechlin</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Hennegau
or Hainault
united with
Holland.
1299.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the South of them
lay the county of <i>Hennegau</i> or <i>Hainault</i>. At the end
of the thirteenth century, this county was joined by
marriage with that of Holland. Holland and Hainault
were thus detached possessions of a common prince, with
Brabant lying between them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mark of
Namur.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
South of Brabant lay
the small mark or county of <i>Namur</i>, which, without
being united to Flanders, was held by a branch of the
princes of that house.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Common
character of
these states.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>All these states, though their princes held of two
separate over-lords, had much in common, and were
well fitted to be worked together into a single political
system. They had much in common in the physical
character of the country, and in the unusual number
of great and flourishing cities which these countries
contained.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Importance
of the cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
None of these cities indeed actually reached
the position of free cities of the Empire; but their
wealth, and the degree of practical independence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
they possessed, forms a main feature in the history of
the Low Countries. In point of language, the northern
part of these states spoke various dialects of Low-Dutch,
from Flemish to Frisian; in the southern lands
of Hainault, Artois, and Namur, the language, though not
French, was not Teutonic, but an independent Romance
speech, the Walloon.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>South-western
group of
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the west of these states lay
another group of small principalities connected with the
former greater group in many ways, but not so closely as
those which we have just gone through.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bishopric
of Lüttich.<br />
Duchies of
Luxemburg
and Limburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great ecclesiastical
principality of <i>Lüttich</i> or <i>Liège</i>, lying in two
detached parts, divided the lands of which we have
been speaking from the counties, afterwards duchies, of
<i>Lüzelburg</i> or <i>Luxemburg</i> and of <i>Limburg</i>. Of these the
more distant Limburg passed in the fourteenth century
to the Dukes of Brabant.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luxemburg
a Duchy.
1353.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Luxemburg is famous as
having given a series of princes to the kingdom of
Bohemia and to the Empire, and in their hands it rose to
the rank of a duchy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geldern.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, to the north of Lüttich,
forming a connecting link between this group of states
and the more purely Frisian powers, lay the duchy of
<i>Geldern</i>, of whose quarters the most northern portion
stretched to the Zuyder Zee. These eastern states,
though not so closely connected with one another as
those to the west, were easily led into the same political
system.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Middle
position of
all these
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Without drawing any hard and fast line,
we may say that all the states of this region formed, if not
yet a middle state, yet a middle system, apart alike from
France and the Empire, though in various ways connected
with both. Mainly Imperial, mainly Teutonic,
they were not wholly so.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>French
influence.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides the homage lawfully
due to France from Flanders and Artois, French influence
in various ways, in politics, in manners, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
language, had made great inroads in the southern
Netherlands. Brabant and Hainault had practically
quite as much to do with France as with the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Walloon
language.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And this French influence was of course helped by
the fact that a considerable region in the south was,
though not of French, yet not of Teutonic speech.
Altogether,
with much to unite them to the great powers on
either side, with much to keep them apart from either of
them, with much more to unite them to one another,
the states of the Netherlands might almost seem to be
designed by nature to be united under a single political
head.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
the Netherlands
under
the Dukes
of Burgundy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Such a head was supplied by the Dukes of Burgundy
and Counts of Flanders, by whom, in the course
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, nearly the whole
of the Netherlands was united into a single power which
was to be presently broken into two by the results of
religious divisions.</p>


<p class="p2">Leaving then for the present the growth and fall of
the Burgundian power in the lands more to the south,
we will go on to trace the steps by which the provinces
of the Low Countries were united under the Valois
Dukes and their Austrian descendants.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reign of
Philip the
Good.
1419-1467.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great
increase of territory in this region was made during the
long reign of Philip the Good.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Namur.
1421-1429.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
His first acquisition was
the county of <i>Namur</i>, a small and outlying district,
but one which, as small and outlying, would still more
strongly suggest the rounding off of the scattered territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1429-1433.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A series of marriages and disputes next enabled
Philip to make a much more important extension
of his dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1405.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Brabant and Limburg had
passed to a younger branch of the Burgundian House.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1418.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
John, Duke of Brabant, the cousin of Philip by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
marriage with Jacqueline, Countess of Holland and Hainault,
united those states for a moment. The disputes
and confusions which followed on her marriages and
divorces led to the annexation of her territories by the
Duke of Burgundy, a process which was finally concluded
by the formal cession of her dominions by Jacqueline.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Brabant
and Limburg.
1430.<br />
Holland
and Hainault.
1433.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile Philip had succeeded to Brabant
and Limburg, and the union of Flanders, Brabant, Hainault,
Zealand, and Holland, together made a dominion
which took in all the greatest Netherland states, and
formed a compact mass of territory. On this presently
followed a great acquisition of territory which was more
strictly French than the fiefs which Philip already held
of the French crown in Flanders and Artois. The
Treaty of Arras, by which Philip, hitherto the ally of
England against France, made peace with his western
overlord, gave him, under the form of mortgage, the
lands on the Somme.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The towns
on the
Somme.
1435-1483.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The acquisition of these lands,
<i>Ponthieu</i>, <i>Vermandois</i>, <i>Amiens</i>, and <i>Boulogne</i>, advanced
the Burgundian frontier to a dangerous neighbourhood
to Paris on this side as well as on the other.
It had the further effect of keeping the small continental
possessions which England still kept at Calais
and Guisnes apart from the French territory. During
the reigns of Philip and Charles the Bold, the continental
neighbour of England was not France but Burgundy.
But this great southern dominion was not
lasting. The towns on the Somme, redeemed and again
recovered, passed on the fall of Charles the Bold once
more into French hands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovered
by France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
So did Artois itself, and,
though Artois was won back, Amiens and the rest
were not. Yet, if the towns on the Somme had
stayed under the rule of the successive masters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
the Low Countries, it might by this time have seemed
as natural for Amiens to be Belgian as it now seems
natural for Cambray and Valenciennes to be French.
The Treaty of Madrid drew a definite boundary.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>France resigns
the
homage of

1526.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
France gave up all claim to homage from Flanders and
Artois, and Charles the Fifth, in his Burgundian, or
rather in his Flemish, character, finally gave up all claim
to the lands on the Somme.</p>

<p>The south-western frontier was thus fixed; but
meanwhile the new state had advanced in other directions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luxemburg.
1443.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Philip’s last great acquisition was the duchy
of <i>Luxemburg</i>. He now possessed the greater part of
the Netherlands; but his dominions were still intersected
by the bishoprics of Utrecht and Lüttich and the duchy
of Geldern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geldern

Of the two great ecclesiastical principalities by

Dukes, and though it came largely under their influence,
was never formally annexed.

But the temporal principality
of the Bishop of <i>Utrecht</i> was secularized under
Charles the Fifth. <i>Friesland</i>, the Friesland immediately
east of the Zuyder Zee, was already reincorporated with
the dominions of the prince who represented the ancient
counts of Holland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dominions

The whole Netherlands were

in the new division of the Empire. The bishopric of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
Lüttich, which intersected the whole southern part of
the country, remained in the circle of Westfalia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The seventeen
provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Seventeen
provinces, each keeping much of separate being,
were united under a single prince, and, since the
treaty of Madrid, they were free from any pretensions
on the part of foreign powers. The Netherlands
formed one of the most compact and important
parts of the scattered dominions of the Emperor who
was also lord of Burgundy and Castile.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their separation

the crowns of Castile and Aragon. In Spanish hands
they acted less as a middle state than as a power which
helped to hem in France on both sides. Had the great
revolt of the Netherlands ended in the final liberation
of the whole seventeen provinces, the middle state would
have been formed in its full strength.

As it was, the
work of the War of Independence was imperfect. The
northern provinces won their freedom in the form of
a federal commonwealth. The southern provinces remained
dependencies of Spain, to become the chosen
fighting ground of European armies, the chosen plaything
of European diplomacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Seven
United
Provinces.
1578.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The end of the long war of independence waged by
the northern provinces was the establishment of the
famous federal commonwealth of the <i>Seven United Provinces</i>,
<i>Holland</i>, <i>Zealand</i>, <i>Utrecht</i>, <i>Gelderland</i>, <i>Over-Yssel</i>,
<i>Friesland</i>, and <i>Groningen</i>. These answered
nearly to the dominions of the Counts of Holland and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
Bishops of Utrecht in earlier times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gelderland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But besides
these, part of the duchy of <i>Geldern</i> formed one of the
United Provinces, while its southern part shared the
fate of the southern provinces. But, besides the
United Seven, the Confederation also kept parts of
Brabant, Geldern, and Flanders as common possessions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formal independence
of the Empire.
1648.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The power thus formed, one which so long
held an European importance quite disproportioned to
its geographical extent, had under Burgundian rule become
practically independent of the Empire, but it was
only by the Peace of Westfalia that its independence
was formally acknowledged. The maritime strength of
the Confederation made it more than an European power.
It became a colonizing power in three parts of the world.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonies of
the Netherlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
the Seven Provinces extended their dominion
over many points on the continent of India and over
the neighbouring island of <i>Ceylon</i>, over the great equatorial
islands of <i>Java</i>, <i>Sumatra</i>, and the <i>Moluccas</i>, over
many points in <i>Guinea</i> and southern Africa, and over
part of <i>Guiana</i> in South America.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New

But the great
North American settlement of <i>New Netherland</i> passed
to England, and <i>New Amsterdam</i> became <i>New York</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>No real
name for
the county.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Singularly enough, this great power never had any
strict geographical name. <i>Netherlands</i> was too large, as
it took in the whole of the Low Countries and not the
emancipated provinces only. <i>Holland</i> was too small,
as being the name of one province only, though the
greatest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
name
<i>Dutch</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And, by one of the oddest cases of caprice
of language, in common English usage the name of the
whole Teutonic race settled down on this one small
part of it, and the men of the Seven Provinces came to
be exclusively spoken of as <i>Dutch</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the southern provinces, the greater part
of Brabant and Flanders, with Artois, Hennegau or
Hainault, Namur, Limburg, Luxemburg, and the
southern part of Geldern,—taking in Antwerp at
one end and Cambray at the other—remained under
the sovereignty of the representatives of the Burgundian
Dukes. That is, they remained an outlying dependency
of the Spanish monarchy. But their southern
frontier was open to constant aggressions on the part of
France.

from England.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Philippeville,

The treaty also added to France
several points along the frontiers of Hainault, Liège,
and Luxemburg, including the detached fortresses of
<i>Philippeville</i> and <i>Marienburg</i>, and <i>Thionville</i> famous
in far earlier days. During the endless wars of Lewis’
reign, the boundary fluctuated with each treaty.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1668.<br />

At last the
boundary was finally fixed by the Peace of Utrecht in
the last days of Lewis. Parts of Flanders and Hainault
were finally confirmed to France, which thus kept
<i>Lille</i>, <i>Cambray</i>, and <i>Valenciennes</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Spanish

The provinces which
had hitherto been Spanish now passed to the only
surviving branch of the House of Austria, that which
reigned in the archduchy and supplied the hereditary
candidates for the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexed

The first wars of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
French Revolution added the Austrian Netherlands to
France, and with them the bishopric of Lüttich which
still so oddly divided them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom
of Holland.
1806-1810.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A later stage of the days
of confusion changed the Seven United Provinces,
enlarged by the addition of East Friesland, into a
<i>Kingdom of Holland</i>, one of the states which the new
conqueror carved out for the benefit of his kinsfolk.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Holland
annexed by
France.
1810-1813.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Presently the new kingdom was incorporated with the
new ‘Empire,’ along with the German lands to the
north-east of it. The Corsican had at last carried out
the schemes of the Valois kings, and the whole Burgundian
heritage formed for a moment part of France.</p>


<p class="p2 pb2">At the general settlement of Europe, after the long
wars with France, the restoration of the Low Countries
as a middle state was a main object.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom

This was brought
about by the union of the whole Netherlands into a single
kingdom bearing that name. The southern boundary
did not differ very greatly from that fixed by the
Peace of Utrecht.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The boundaries.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As in the case of the Savoyard frontier,
France kept a little more by the arrangements of 1814
than she finally kept by those of 1815. To the east,
East-Friesland passed to Hannover, leaving the boundary
of the new kingdom not very different from that of
the two earlier powers which it represented, gaining
only a small territory on the banks of the Maes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Incorporation
of Lüttich.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
the bishopric of Lüttich was incorporated with the lands

to be German ground.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grand
Duchy of

The new king, as we have
already seen, entered the German confederation in his
character of Grand Duke of <i>Luxemburg</i>, the duchy being
somewhat shortened to the east in favour of Prussia.
Lastly, after fifteen years of union, the new kingdom again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
split asunder.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom

It was now divided into the kingdom

old Spanish or Austrian Netherlands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Luxemburg
divided.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But part of Limburg
remained to the northern kingdom, and its sovereign
also kept part of Luxemburg, as a district state, forming
part of the German confederation. The western part
of the duchy formed part of the kingdom of Belgium.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1867.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Later events, as has been already recorded, have severed
the last tie between Germany and the Netherlands; they
have wiped out the last survival of the days when the
Counts of Holland and of Luxemburg were alike princes
of the German kingdom.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
Burgundian
rule.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The above may pass as a sketch of the fluctuations
along the borderland in their European aspect. It is
needless to go through every small shifting of frontier,
or to recount in detail the history of small border principalities
like <i>Saint Pol</i> and <i>Bouillon</i>. The main historical
aspect of these countries is their tendency, in
all ages, to form somewhat of a middle system between
two greater powers on either side of them. The guaranteed
neutrality of Belgium and the guaranteed neutrality
of Switzerland are alike survivals or revivals—it
is hard to say which they should be called—of
the instinctive feeling which, in the ninth century, called
the Lotharingian kingdom into being. The modern
form of this thousand-year old idea was made possible
through the growth of the power of the Burgundian
Dukes of the House of Valois.</p>

<p>The real historical work of those dukes was thus
done in those parts of their dominions from which
they did not take their name, but which took their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
name from them. The history of their other dominions
may be told in a few words; indeed a great part
of it has been told already.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Schemes of
Charles the
Bold.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The schemes of Charles
the Bold for uniting his scattered dominions by the conquest
of the duchy of Lorraine, for extending the
power thus formed to the sea-board of the royal Burgundy,
for forming in short a middle kingdom stretching
from the Ocean to the Mediterranean, acting as a
barrier alike between France and Germany and between
France and Italy, remained mere schemes. They are
important only as showing how deeply the idea or the
memory of a middle state was still fixed in men’s minds.
The conquests of Charles in Lorraine, his purchases
in Elsass, were momentary possessions which hardly
touch geography. But the fall of Charles, by causing
the break-up of the southern dominion of his house,
helped to give greater importance to its northern
dominion. While the Netherlands grew together, the
Burgundies split asunder. After the fall of Charles the
fate of the two Burgundies was much the same as the
fate of Flanders and Artois. Both were for a while
seized by France; but the county, like Artois, was afterwards
recovered for a season. The duchy of Burgundy
was lost for ever; the county, along with the outlying
county of Charolois, remained to those who by
female succession represented the Burgundian Dukes,
that is to Charles the Fifth and his Spanish son. The
annexation of the Burgundian county, and with it of
the city of Besançon, by Lewis the Fourteenth has
been recorded in an earlier section.</p>

<h3>§ 9. <i>The Dominions of Austria.</i></h3>

<p class="pb2">We now come to one among these German states
which have parted off from the kingdom of Germany
whose course has been widely different from the
rest, and whose modern European importance stands
on a widely different level. As the Lotharingian and
Frisian lands parted off on the north-west of the
kingdom, as a large part of the Swabian lands parted
off to the south-west of the kingdom, so the <i>Eastern
Mark</i>, the mark of <i>Austria</i>, parted off no less, but
with widely different consequences.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
the name
<i>Oesterreich</i>,
<i>Austria</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The name of
<i>Austria</i>, <i>Oesterreich</i>—<i>Ostrich</i> as our forefathers wrote
it—is, naturally enough, a common name for the
eastern part of any kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Other lands
so called.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Frankish kingdom
of the Merwings had its <i>Austria</i>; the Italian kingdom
of the Lombards had its <i>Austria</i> also. We are half
inclined to wonder that the name was never given in
our own island either to Essex or to East-Anglia. But,
while the other Austrias have passed away, the <i>Oesterreich</i>,
the <i>Austria</i>, the Eastern mark, of the German
kingdom, its defence against the Magyar invader, has
lived on to our own times. It has not only lived on,
but it has become one of the chief European powers.
And it has become so by a process to which it would
be hard to find a parallel.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Special
position of
the Austrian
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Austrian duchy supplied
Germany with so many Kings, and Rome with
so many Emperors, that something of Imperial character
came to cleave to the duchy itself. Its Dukes, in
resigning, first, the crown of Germany, and then all
connexion with Germany, have carried with them into
their new position the titles and bearings of the German
Cæsars.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union with
Hungary.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The power which began as a mark against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
the Magyar came to have a common sovereign with
the Magyar kingdom; and the Austrian duchy and
Magyar kingdom, each drawing with it a crowd of
smaller states of endless nationalities, have figured
together in the face of modern Europe as the <i>Austrian
Empire</i> or the <i>Austro-Hungarian Monarchy</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The so-called
‘Empire’
of
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is
not easy, in drawing a map, to find a place for the
‘Empire’ of Austria. The Archduchy is there, and its
sovereign has not dropped his archiducal title. A crowd
of kingdoms, duchies, counties, and lordships, all acknowledging
the sovereignty of the same prince, are there
also. But it is not easy to find the geographical place of
an ‘Empire’ of Austria, as distinct from the Archduchy.
Nor is it easy to understand on what principle an
‘Empire’ of Austria can be understood as taking in all
the states which happen to own the Hungarian King
and Austrian Archduke as their sovereign. The matter
is made more difficult when we remember that the
title of ‘Hereditary Emperor of Austria’ was first taken
while its bearer was still King of Germany and Roman
Emperor-elect.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
separate
states
under the
Austrian
House.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, putting questions like these aside,
the gradual union of a great number of states, German
and non-German, under the common rule of the archiducal
house of Austria, by whatever name we call the
power so formed, is a great fact both of history and of
geography. A number of states, originally independent
of one another, differing in origin and language and
everything that makes states differ from one another,
some of them members of the former Empire, some not,
have, as a matter of fact, come together to form a power
which fills a large space in modern history and on the
modern map.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lack of
national
unity.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it is a power which is altogether
lacking in national unity. It is a power which is not coextensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
with any nation, but which takes in parts of many
nations. It cannot even be said that there is a dominant
nation surrounded by subject nations.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German,
Magyar,
and other
races.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Magyar
nation in its unity, and a fragment of the German
nation, stand side by side on equal terms, while Italians,
Roumans, and Slaves of almost every branch of the
Slavonic race, are grouped around those two.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>No strictly
federal tie.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There
is no federal tie; it is a stretch of language to apply
the federal name to the present relation between the
two chief powers of Hungary and Austria. Nor
can any strictly federal tie be said to unite Bohemia,
Dalmatia, Croatia, and Galicia. And yet these other
members of the general body are not mere subject
provinces, like the dominions of Old Rome. The same
prince is sovereign of a crowd of separate states, two
of which stand out prominently as centres among the
rest. There is neither national unity, nor federation, nor
mere subjection of one land or nation to another. All
this has come by the gradual union by various means of
many crowns upon the same brow.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Anomalous
nature of
the Austrian
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The result is an
anomalous power which has nothing else exactly like
it, past or present. But the very anomaly makes the
growth of such a power a more curious study.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern
Mark.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The beginnings of the Austrian state are to be
found in the small <i>Mark</i> on the Danube, lying between
Bohemia, Moravia, and the Duchy of Kärnthen or Carinthia.
It appears in its first form as an appendage
to Bavaria.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This mark Frederick Barbarossa raised
into a duchy, under its first duke Henry the Second,
and it was enlarged to the westward at the expense of
Bavaria by the addition of the lands above the Enns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Austria,
1156.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus was formed the original <i>Duchy of Austria</i>, the
duchy of the Dukes of the House of Babenberg. It had
not long risen to ducal rank before it began to extend
itself at the expense of states which had hitherto been
of greater moment than itself. Itself primarily a mark
against the Magyar, Austria had to the south of it
the lands where the German Kingdom marched at
once upon the Magyar, the Slave, and the Kingdom
of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Carinthia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Here lay the great Duchy of Carinthia, a
land where the population was mainly Slave, though
on this frontier the Slavonic population had been
brought into much earlier and more thorough subjection
to the German Kings than the Slaves on the north-eastern
frontier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Styria,
1180;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the time of the foundation of the
duchy of Austria, the Carinthian duchy had begun to
split in pieces, and its northern part, hitherto the
<i>Upper Carinthian Mark</i>, grew into the Duchy of <i>Steyermark</i>
or <i>Styria</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>united to
Austria,
1192.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Twelve years later, Leopold the
Fifth of Austria inherited the duchy of Styria, a duchy
greater than his own, by the will of its duke Ottokar.
Carinthia itself went on as a separate duchy; but it
now took in only a narrow territory in the south-western
part of the old duchy, and that broken up by
outlying possessions of the archbishops of Salzburg
and other ecclesiastical lords.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The county
of Görz.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the south grew up a
considerable power in the hands of the counts of <i>Görz</i>
or <i>Gorizia</i> on the Italian border.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ecclesiastical
position
of its
Counts.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The possessions of
these counts stretched, though not continuously, from
Tyrol to Istria, and their influence was further enlarged
by their position as advocates of the bishoprics of <i>Trent</i>
and <i>Brixen</i> and of the more famous patriarchate of
<i>Aquileia</i>. These are the lands, the marchlands of
Germany towards its eastern and south-eastern neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
which came by gradual annexations to form the
German possessions of the Austrian power. But the
further growth of that power did not begin till the
duchy itself had passed away to the hands of a wholly
new line of princes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Momentary
union of
Austria and
Bohemia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">The first change was one which brought about for a
moment from one side an union which was afterwards
to be brought about in a more lasting shape from the
other side. This was the annexation of Austria by the
kingdom of <i>Bohemia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bohemia a
kingdom,
1158.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
That duchy had been raised to
the rank of a kingdom, though of course without ceasing
to be a fief of the Empire, a few years after the mark of
Austria had become a duchy. The death of the last
duke of Austria of the Babenberg line led to a disputed
succession and a series of wars, in which the princes of
Bavaria, Bohemia, and Hungary all had their share.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ottokar of
Bohemia
annexes
Austria
and Styria,
1252-1262.
Carinthia,
1269.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the end, between marriage, conquest, and royal grant,
Ottokar king of Bohemia obtained the duchies of
Austria and Styria, and a few years later he further
added Carinthia by the bequest of its Duke. Thus a
new power was formed, by which several German
states came into the power of a Slavonic king.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Great
power of
Ottokar.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
power of that king for a moment reached the Baltic as
well as the Hadriatic; for Ottokar carried his arms
into Prussia, and became the founder of Königsberg.
But this great power was but momentary. Bohemia
and Austria were again separated, and Austria, with
its indefinite mission of extension over so many lands,
including Bohemia itself, passed to a house sprung from
a distant part of Germany.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>House of
Habsburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have now come to the European beginnings of
the second House of Austria, the house whose name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
seems to have become inseparably connected with the
name of Austria, though the spot from which that house
drew its name has long ceased to be an Austrian possession.
This is the house of the Counts of <i>Habsburg</i>.
They took this name from their castle on the lower
course of the Aar, in the north-west corner of the
Aargau, in that southern Swabian land where the Old
League of High Germany was presently to arise, and
so greatly to extend itself at the cost of the power of
Habsburg.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
Habsburg,
Kyburg,
and Lenzburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By an union of the lands of Habsburg
with those of the Counts of <i>Kyburg</i> and <i>Lenzburg</i>, a
considerable, though straggling, dominion was formed.
It stretched in and out among the mountains and lakes,
taking in Luzern, and forming a dangerous neighbour
to the free city of Zürich.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their possession
in
Elsass.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides these lands, the same
house also held <i>Upper Elsass</i> with the title of Landgrave,
a dominion separated from the other Swabian
lands of the House by the territory of the free city of
Basel.

The lord of this great Swabian dominion, the

and having broken the power of Ottokar, bestowed the
duchies of Austria and Styria on his son Albert, afterwards
King.

Carinthia at first formed part of the same

of Görz and Tyrol. Görz passed to another branch of
the house of its own Counts. Three powers were thus
formed in these regions, the duchies of <i>Austria</i> and
<i>Styria</i>, the duchy of <i>Carinthia</i> with the county of
<i>Tyrol</i>, and the county of <i>Görz</i>.</p>

<p>Thus under Albert the possessions of the House of
Habsburg were large, but widely scattered. The two
newly acquired eastern duchies not only gave its princes
their highest titles, but they formed a compact territory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
well suited for extension northward and southward.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Falling off
of the
Swabian
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But among the outlying Swabian territories,
though some parts remained to the Austrian House
down to the end of the German Kingdom, the tendency
was to diminish and gradually to part off altogether
from Germany. In the lands south of the Rhine this
happened through union with the Confederates; in the
Alsatian lands it happened at a later stage through
French annexation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Connexion
of Austria
with the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It is to be hoped that it is no longer needful to
explain that the hereditary lands of the House of Habsburg
or Austria had no inherent connexion with the
German Kingdom and Roman Empire of which they
were fiefs, beyond the fact that they were among its
fiefs. They were further connected with it only by the
accident that, from Rudolf onwards, many princes of
that house were chosen Kings, and that, from the middle
of the fifteenth century, onwards, all the Kings were
chosen from that house and from the house into which
it merged by female succession. It is to be hoped that
there is no longer any need to explain that every Emperor
was not Duke of Austria, and that every Duke of
Austria was not Emperor. But it may be needful to
explain that every Duke of Austria was not master of
the whole dominions of the House of Austria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Divisions
of the
Austrian
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The divisions,
the reunions, the joint reigns, which are common
to the House of Austria with other German princely
houses, become at once more important and more puzzling
in the case of a house which gradually came to
stand above all the others in European rank. The
caution is specially needful in the case of the Swabian
lands, as the history of the Confederates is liable to be
greatly misunderstood, if every Duke of Austria who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
appears there is taken for the sole sovereign of the
Austrian dominions. It is needless to go here through
all these shiftings between princes of the same house.
Through all changes the unity of the house and its possessions
was maintained, even while they were parted out
or held in common by different members of the house.
But it is important to bear in mind that some of the
Dukes of Austria who figure in the history of Switzerland
were rather Landgraves of Elsass or Counts of
Tyrol than Dukes of Austria in any practical sense.</p>

<p>The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries may be
defined as a time during which the Austrian House on
the whole steadily advanced in the Eastern part of its
dominions and steadily fell back in the Western. But
in the course of the fourteenth century an acquisition
was made which, without making them absolutely continuous,
brought them into something more like geographical
connexion with one another.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisition
of
Carinthia
and Tyrol,
1335.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This was the
acquisition of the Duchy of Carinthia and County of
<i>Tyrol</i>, the latter of which lands lay conveniently
between the Eastern and Western dominions of the house.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Austrian
territory.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These now stretched continuously from the Bohemian
frontier to Istria, and they threw out, in the form of
Tyrol and the Swabian lands, a scattered, but nearly
continuous, territory stretching to the borders of Lorraine
and the county of Burgundy. The Austrian
possessions now touched the eastern gulf of the Hadriatic
and came into the neighbourhood of the Dalmatian
Archipelago.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Commendation
of
Trieste,
1382.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Somewhat later they reached
the main Hadriatic itself, when the city of <i>Trieste</i>,
hitherto disputed between the commonwealth of Venice
and the patriarchs of Aquileia, commended itself to
the Austrian Duke Leopold as its lord. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
same Leopold who four years later fell at Sempach.
By this time the Swabian possessions had been increased
north of the Rhine, while south of the Rhine the
Austrian dominion was steadily giving way.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Thurgau,
1460.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Confederates
and their several cantons advanced in every
way, by purchase and conquest, till, after the loss of
Thurgau, the House of Austria kept nothing south
of the Rhine except the towns known as the <i>Waldstädte</i>.</p>

<p>By this time the division of the estates of the house
had taken a more lasting shape. One branch reigned
in Austria, another in Carinthia and Styria, a third in
Tyrol and the other western lands. At this time begins
the unbroken series of Austrian elections to the German
and Imperial crowns.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Albert the
Second,

Then Frederick the Third, the first
Emperor of the House, united the Austrian and Carinthian
duchies, and raised Austria to the unique rank of
an Archduchy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Siegmund,
Count of
Tyrol, &amp;c.,

Meanwhile, Siegmund Count of Tyrol
held the western lands, and appears as Duke of Austria
in Confederate and Burgundian history. He there
figures as the prince who lost Thurgau to the Confederates
and who mortgaged his Alsatian lands to Charles
the Bold.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Maximilian,

house of Austria were united.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning

with lands
beyond the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But by this time the
affairs of the purely German lands which had hitherto
formed the possessions of the Austrian house had begun
to be mixed up with the succession to lands and kingdoms
beyond the Empire, and with lands which, though
technically within the Empire, had a distinct being of
their own. In the course of the fifteenth century the
house of Austria, hitherto simply one of the chief
German princely houses, put on two special characters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Succession
of
Austrian
Kings and
Emperors.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It became, as we have already seen, the house which
exclusively supplied kings and Emperors to Germany
and the Empire. And it became, by virtue of its hereditary
possessions rather than of its Imperial position,
one of the chief European powers. For a while the
greatest of European powers, it has remained a great
European power down to our own time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union with
Bohemia
and Hungary.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The special feature in the history of the house of
Austria from the fifteenth century onwards is its connexion—a
connexion more or less broken, but still constantly
recurring till in the end it becomes fully permanent—with
the kingdom of Bohemia within the Empire
and with the kingdom of Hungary beyond its bounds.
These possessions have given the Austrian power its
special character, that of a power formed by the union
under one prince of several wholly distinct nations
or parts of nations which have no tie beyond that
union. The Austrian princes, originally purely German,
equally in their Swabian and in their Austrian
possessions, had already, by the extension of their
power to the south, obtained some Slavonic and some
Italian-speaking subjects. Still, as a power, they were
purely German.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Various acquisitions
of Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But in the period which begins in
the fifteenth and goes on into the nineteenth century,
we shall see them gradually gathering together, sometimes
gaining, sometimes losing—gaining and losing by
every process, warlike and peaceful, by which territory
can be gained or lost—a crowd of kingdoms, duchies,
and counties, scattered over all parts of Europe from
Flanders to Transsilvania. But it is the acquisition of
the two crowns of Bohemia and Hungary which, above
all others, gave the House of Austria its special position
as a middle power, a power belonging at once to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
system of Western and to the system of Eastern Europe.
Among the endless shiftings of the states which have
been massed together under the rule of the House of
Habsburg, that house has more than once been at the
same moment the neighbour of the Gaul and the neighbour
of the Turk; and it has sometimes found Gaul and
Turk arrayed together against it. Add to all this that,
though the connexion between the house of Austria
and the Empire was a purely personal one, renewed in
each generation by a special election, still the fact that
so many kings of Hungary and archdukes of Austria
were chosen Emperors one after another, caused the
house itself, after the Empire was abolished, to look
in the eyes of many like a continuation of the power
which had come to an end. The peculiar position of
the Austrian house could hardly have been obtained
by a mere union of Hungary, Austria, and the other states
under princes none of whom were raised to Imperial
rank. Nor could it have been obtained by a series of
mere dukes of Austria, even though they had been chosen
Emperors from generation to generation. It was through
the accidental union under one sovereign of a crowd of
states which had no natural connexion with each other,
and through the further accident that the Empire
itself seemed to become a possession of the House,
that the House of Habsburg, and its representative the
House of Lorraine, have won their unique position
among European powers.</p>

<p>The first hints, so to speak, of a coming union
between the Hungarian and Bohemian kingdoms and
the Austrian duchy began, as we have seen, in the days
of Ottokar. A Bohemian king had then held the Austrian
duchy, while a Hungarian king had for a moment occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
part of Styria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations
with Hungary
and
Bohemia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the later form which the union
was to take was not that of the Bohemian or the Hungarian
reigning over Austria, but that of the Austrian
reigning over Hungary and Bohemia. The duchy was
not to be added to either of the kingdoms; but both
kingdoms were in course of time to be added to the
duchy. The growth of both Hungary and Bohemia as
kingdoms will be spoken of elsewhere. We have now
to deal only with their relations to the Austrian House.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rudolf, son
of Albert,
King of
Bohemia,
1306.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
For a moment, early in the fourteenth century, an
Austrian prince, son of the first Austrian King of Germany,
was actually acknowledged as King of Bohemia.
But this connexion was only momentary. The first
beginnings of anything like a more permanent connexion
begin a hundred and thirty years later.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Albert the
Second,
King of
Hungary
and Bohemia,
1438.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
second Austrian King of Germany wore both the
Hungarian and the Bohemian crowns by virtue of his
marriage with the daughter of the Emperor and King
Siegmund. The steps towards the union of the various
crowns are now beginning.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Siegmund,
King of
Hungary,

King of the
Romans,

King of
Bohemia,

Siegmund was the third
King of Bohemia who had worn the crown of Germany,
the second who had worn the crown of the Empire.
Under his son-in-law, Hungary, Bohemia, and Austria
were for a moment united with the German crown;
in the next reign, as we have seen, begins the lasting
connexion between Austria and the Empire. But the
Hungarian and Bohemian kingdoms parted again.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Wladislaus

One
Austrian King, the son of Albert, reigned at least nominally
over both kingdoms, as well as over the special
Austrian duchy. But the final union did not come for
another eighty years. The Turk was now threatening
and conquering. At Mohacz Lewis, king of the two
kingdoms, fell before the invaders.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ferdinand,

His Bohemian

day to this, unless we except the momentary choice of
the Winter King, the Palatine Frederick, the Bohemian
crown has always stayed in the House of Austria. And
for many generations it has been worn by the actual
sovereign of the Austrian archduchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
the union
with Hungary.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The acquisition of the crown of Hungary was of
greater importance. It at once put the Austrian House
into a wholly new position; it gave it its new later
character of a middle state between Eastern and Western
Europe. The duchy had begun as a mark against
the Turanian and heathen invaders of earlier times.
Those Turanian and heathen invaders had long before
settled down into a Christian kingdom; they had latterly
become the foremost champions of Christendom
against the Turanian and Mahometan invaders who had
seized the throne of the Eastern Cæsars.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mission

With the
crown of Hungary, the main duty of the Hungarian
crown, the defence of Christendom against the Ottoman,
passed to the Archdukes and Emperors of the Austrian
House.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Austrian

But for a long time Hungary was a most
imperfect and precarious possession of its Austrian
Kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1526-1699.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
For more than a century and a half after the
election of Ferdinand, his rule and that of his successors
was disputed and partial. They had from the very
beginning to strive against rival kings, while the
greater part of the kingdom and of the lands attached
to the crown was either held by the Turk himself
or by princes who acknowledged the Turk as their
superior lord. These strictly Hungarian affairs, as well
as the changes on the frontier towards the Turk, will
be spoken of elsewhere.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Peace of
Passarowitz,

It was not till the eighteenth
century that the Austrian Kings were in full possession
of the whole Hungarian kingdom and all its
dependencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisition
of Görz,
1500.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile the Austrian power had been making
advances in other quarters. At the end of the fifteenth
century the Austrian possessions at the north-east of
the Hadriatic were greatly enlarged by the addition of
the county of <i>Görz</i>, which carried with it the fallen
city of Aquileia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New position
towards
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A more direct path towards Italian
dominion was thus opened. The wars of the League
of Cambray made no permanent addition to Austrian
dominion in this quarter; but the master of Trieste and
Aquileia, whose territory cut off Venice from her Istrian
possessions, might already almost pass for an Italian
sovereign.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dominions
of Charles
the Fifth.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Under Charles the Fifth the House of
Austria became, as we have seen, possessed of a vast
Italian dominion. But after him it passed away alike
from the Empire and the German branch of the house,
to become part of the heritage of the Austrian Kings of
Spain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austrian
rule in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was not, as we have already seen, till the beginning
of the eighteenth century that either an Emperor
or a reigning archduke again obtained any territory
within the acknowledged bounds of Italy. The fluctuations
of Austrian rule in Italy, from the acquisition of
the Duchy of Milan down to our own day, have been
already told in the Italian section. Lombardy and
Venetia are now again Italian; but Austria still keeps
the north-east corner of the great gulf. She still keeps
Görz and Aquileia, Trieste and all Istria, to say nothing
of the dangerous way which her frontier still stretches
on Italian ground in the land of Trent and Roveredo.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Burgundian
possessions.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These last named possessions still abide as traces of the
Austrian advance in these regions, and its fluctuations
there have been among the most important facts of
modern history. Another series of Austrian acquisitions
in the West of Europe have altogether passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
away. The great Burgundian inheritance passed to
the House of Austria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Maximilian

But it was only for a short time,
in the persons of Maximilian and Philip, that it was in any
way united to the actual Austrian Archduchy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Austrian
Netherlands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After
Charles the Fifth the Burgundian possessions passed, like
those in Italy, to the Spanish branch of the House, and,
just as in Italy, it was not till the eighteenth century that
actual Emperors or archdukes again reigned over a part
of the Netherlands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Elsass.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before this time the Alsatian dominion
of Austria had passed away to France, and the
remnant of her Swabian possessions passed away, as we
have seen, in the days of general confusion. The
changes of her territory in Germany during that period
have been already spoken of. Her acquisitions in Eastern
Europe will come more fully elsewhere; but a word must
be given to them here.

Looking at the House of Austria
simply as a power, without reference to the German
or non-German character of its dominions, the loss of
<i>Silesia</i> may be looked on as counterbalanced by the
territory gained from Poland at the first and third partitions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Galicia and
Lodomeria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first partition gave the Austrian House
a territory of which the greater part was originally
Russian rather than Polish, and in which the old Russian

into a <i>Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Third partition,

The third

the Duchy of Warsaw, and then to the restored Kingdom
of Poland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation

But Galicia has been kept, and it has

Hungarian kingdom. Parted from them by the whole
extent of that kingdom, and adjoining that kingdom at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>

<p class="p2">This account of the gains and losses of a power
which has gained and lost in so many quarters is
necessary somewhat piecemeal. It may be well then
to end this section with a picture of the Austrian power
as it stood at several points of the history of the last
century and a half, leaving the fluctuating frontier
towards the Turk to be dealt with in our survey of the
more strictly Eastern lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reign of
Maria
Theresa,
1740-1780.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We will begin at a date when we come across a
sovereign whose position is often strangely misunderstood,
the Empress-Queen Maria Theresa—Queen in her
own right of Hungary and Bohemia, Empress by the
election of her husband to the Imperial Crown.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her hereditary
dominions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Pragmatic Sanction of her father Charles the Sixth
made her heiress of all his hereditary dominions. That
is, it made her heiress, within the Empire, of the kingdom
of Bohemia with its dependencies of Moravia and
Silesia—of the Archduchy of Austria with the duchies,
counties, and lordships of Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,
Tyrol, Görz, and Trieste—of Constanz and a few other
outlying Swabian points—as also of Milan, Mantua, and
the Austrian Netherlands, lands which it needs some
stretch, whether of memory or of legal fiction, to look
on as being then in any sense lands of the Empire.
Altogether beyond the Empire, it gave her the Kingdom
of Hungary with its dependent lands of Croatia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
Slavonia, and Transsilvania or Siebenbürgen. These
hereditary dominions, lessened by the loss of Silesia,
increased by the addition of Galicia, she handed on to
their later Kings and Archdukes. Her marriage transferred
those hereditary dominions, it indirectly transferring
the Empire itself, to a new family, the House
of Lorraine. The husband of Maria Theresa, Francis,
who had exchanged his duchy of Lorraine for that of
Tuscany, was in truth the first Lotharingian Emperor.
After him came three Emperors of his house, under
the third of whom the succession of Augustus and
Charles came to an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austrian
dominions
in 1811.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We may take another view of the Austrian territory
at the moment when the French power in Germany was
at its height. The Roman Empire and the German kingdom
had now come to an end; but their last sovereign
still, with whatever meaning, called himself Emperor of
his archduchy, though without dropping his proper title
of Archduke.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New use of
the name
<i>Austria</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From this time the word Austria was
used, commonly but inaccurately, to take in all the
possessions of the House of Austria. And, as all the
possessions of the House of Austria were now geographically
continuous, it became more natural to speak of
them by a single name than it had been when the dominions
of that house in Italy and the Netherlands lay apart
from the great mass of Austrian territory. And at this
moment, when the Empire had come to an end and when
the German Confederation had not yet been formed,
there was no distinction between German and non-German
lands. The ‘Empire’ of Francis the Second
or First, as it stood at the time of Buonaparte’s greatest
power, had, as compared with the hereditary dominions
of Maria Theresa, gone through these changes. Tyrol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
and the Swabian lands had passed to other German
princes; Salzburg had been won and lost again. In
Italy the Venetian possessions had been won and lost,
and they, together with the older Italian possessions of
Austria, had passed to the French kingdom of Italy.
France in her own name had encroached on the Austrian
dominions at two ends. She had absorbed the
Austrian Netherlands at one corner, the newly won
territory of Dalmatia at another. This last territory,
with parts of Carinthia and Carniola, and with the
Hungarian kingdom of Croatia, received, on passing
to France, the name of the <i>Illyrian Provinces</i>.
Illyrian they were in the widest and most purely
geographical sense of that name. But this use of
the Illyrian name was confusing and misleading, as
tending to put out of sight that the true representatives
of the old Illyrian race dwell to the south, not only of
Carinthia and Carniola, but of Dalmatia itself. The
loss of the Austrian possessions in this quarter brought
back the new Austrian ‘Empire’ to the condition of the
original Austrian duchy. It became a wholly inland
dominion, without an inch of sea-coast anywhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austria at

Released from her inland prison, provided
again with a great sea-board on both sides of the

of her freedom, and filched from Montenegro her hard-won
haven of Cattaro. The recovered lands formed,
in the new nomenclature of the Austrian possessions,
the kingdoms of Lombardy and Venice, of Illyria,
and of Dalmatia. The last was an ancient title of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
Hungarian crown. The Kingdom of Illyria was a
continuation of the affected nomenclature which had
been bestowed on the lands which formed it under their
French occupation. We have already traced the driving
out of the Austrian power from Lombardy and Venetia,
its momentary joint possession in Sleswick, Holstein, and
Lauenburg.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy,
1867.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then arose the present
system, the so called <i>dualism</i>, the theory of which
is that the ‘Austro-Hungarian Monarchy’ consists of
two states under a common sovereign. By an odd
turning about of meanings, Austria, once really the
<i>Oesterreich</i>, the Eastern land, of Germany, has become
in truth the Western land, the <i>Neustria</i>, of the
new arrangement. With the Hungarian kingdom are
grouped the principality of Transsilvania and the kingdoms
of Slavonia and Croatia. The Austrian state is
made up of <i>Austria</i> itself—the archduchy with the
addition of <i>Salzburg</i>—the duchy of <i>Styria</i>, the county
of <i>Tyrol</i>, the kingdoms of <i>Bohemia</i>, <i>Galicia</i> and <i>Lodomeria</i>,
<i>Illyria</i>, and <i>Dalmatia</i> with <i>Ragusa</i> and <i>Cattaro</i>.
These last lands are not continuous. Thus two states
are formed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Modern
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In one the dominant German duchy has
Slavonic lands on each side of it, and an Italian fringe
on its coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Modern
Hungary.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the other state, the ruling Magyar
holds also among the subjects of his crown the Slave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
the Rouman, and the outlying Saxon of Siebenbürgen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Herzegovina,
Bosnia,
and Spizza,
1878.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Add to this that the latest arrangements of
all have added to the Austrian dominions, under the
diplomatic phrase of ‘administration,’ the Slavonic
lands of <i>Herzegovina</i> and <i>Bosnia</i>, while the kingdom
of Dalmatia is increased by the harbour of <i>Spizza</i>.
A power like this, which rests on no national basis, but
which has been simply patched together during a
space of six hundred years by this and that grant, this
and that marriage, this and that treaty, is surely an
anachronism on the face of modern Europe. Germany
and Italy are nations as well as powers. Austria,
changed from the <i>Austria</i> of Germany into the
<i>Neustria</i> of Hungary, is simply a name without a
meaning.</p>


<p class="p2">We have thus gone through the geographical
changes of the three Imperial kingdoms, and of the
states and powers which were formed by parts of those
kingdoms falling away, and in some cases uniting themselves
with lands beyond the Empire. They have all
to some extent kept a common history down to our
own time. We have now to turn to another land which
parted off from the Empire in like manner, but which
parted off so early as to become a wholly separate and
rival land, with an altogether independent history of its
own.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE KINGDOM OF FRANCE.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin and
growth of
France.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> process by which a great power grew up to the
west of the Western Empire has something in common
with the process by which the powers spoken of in the
later sections of the last Chapter split off from the
Western Empire. As in the case of Switzerland and
the United Provinces, so in the case of France, a land
which had formed part of the dominions of Charles the
Great became independent of his successors.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
with
Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As in the
case of Austria to the east, so in the case of France to
the west, a duchy of the old Empire grew into a
power distinct from the Empire, and tried to attach
to itself the old Imperial titles and traditions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Different
nature of
the Austrian
and
the French
territories.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
there is more than one point of difference between the
two cases. As a matter of geography, the power of the
Austrian house has for some centuries largely rested
on the possession of dominions beyond the boundaries
of the Carolingian Empire, while it has been only for
a moment, and that chiefly by the annexation of
territory from Austria itself, that France has ever
held any European possessions beyond the Carolingian
frontier.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difference
in the process
of
separation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the true difference lies in the date and
circumstances of the separation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The other
powers split
off after the
Empire has
become
German.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Swabian, Lotharingian,
Frisian, and Austrian lands which gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
split off from the Empire to form distinct states split off
after the Empire had been finally annexed to the crown
of Germany, indeed after Germany and the Empire had
come to mean nearly the same thing. But France can
hardly be said to have split off from the German
kingdom or from the Empire itself. The first prince
of the Western <i>Francia</i> who bore the kingly title was
indeed the man of the King of the East-Franks.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But no
lasting relation, such as afterwards bound the princes
of the Empire to its head, sprang out of his homage.
Again from 887 to 963 the Imperial dignity was not
finally attached to any one kingdom. It fluctuated
between Germany and Italy; it might have passed to
Burgundy; it might have passed to Karolingia, as it
had once already done in the person of Charles the
Bald.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Empire
divided
into four
kingdoms,
of which
three are
again
united,
while one
remains
distinct.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The truer way of putting the matter is to say
that in 887 the Empire split up into four kingdoms, of
which three came together again, and formed the
Empire in a new shape. The fourth kingdom remained
separate; it can hardly be said to have split off from
the Empire, but its separation hindered the full reconstruction
of the Empire. It has had a distinct history,
a history which made it the special rival of the
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Karolingia
receives the
name of
<i>France</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This was <i>Karolingia</i>, the kingdom of the
West-Franks, to which, through the results of the
change of dynasty in 987, the name of <i>France</i> gradually
came to be applied.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>France a
nation as
well as a
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">But there is yet another distinction of greater
practical importance. France was so early detached
from the rest of the elder Frankish dominions that it
was able to form from the first a nation as well as a
power. Its separation happened at the time when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
European nations were forming. The other powers
did not split off till long after those nations were
formed, and they did not in any strict sense form
nations. But France is a nation in the fullest sense.
Its history is therefore different from the history of
Austria, of Burgundy, of Switzerland, or even of Italy.
As a state which had become wholly distinct from the
Empire, which was commonly the rival and enemy of
the Empire, which largely grew at the expense of the
Empire, above all, as a state which won for itself a
most distinct national being, France fully deserves a
chapter, and not a mere section. Still that chapter is
in some sort an appendage to that which deals with the
Imperial kingdoms of the West. It naturally follows
on our survey of those kingdoms, before we go on
further to deal with the European powers which arose
out of the dismemberment of the Empire of the East.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the royal
domain at
the accession
of the
Parisian
house.
987.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We left Karolingia or the Western Kingdom at
that point where the modern French state took its real
beginning under the kings of the house of Paris.
Their duchy of France had since its foundation been
cut short by the great grant of Normandy, and by the
practical independence which had been won by the
counts of <i>Anjou</i>, <i>Maine</i>, and <i>Chartres</i>. By their election
to the kingdom the Dukes of the French added to
their duchy the small territory which up to that time
had still been in the immediate possession of the West-Frankish
Kings at Laon. And, with the crown and the
immediate territory of those kings, the French kings
at Paris also inherited their claim to superiority over
all the states which had arisen within the bounds of the
Western Kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Definition of the word
<i>France</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the name <i>France</i>, as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
used in the times with which we are dealing, means
only the immediate territory of the King.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Two forms
of growth;
annexation
of fiefs of
the French
crown and
of lands altogether
beyond the
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The use of
the name spreads with every increase of that territory,
whether that increase was made by the incorporation
of a fief or by the annexation of territory wholly foreign
to the kingdom. These two processes must be carefully
distinguished. Both went on side by side for some
centuries; but the incorporation of the vassal states
naturally began before the annexation of altogether
foreign territory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Various
feudal
gradations.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Among the fiefs which were gradually annexed
a distinction must be drawn between the great princes
who were really national chiefs owing an external
homage to the French crown, and the lesser counts
whose dominions had been cut off from the original
duchy of France. And a distinction must be
again drawn between these last and the immediate
tenants of the Crown within its own domains, vassals
of the Duke as well as of the King.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The great
vassals.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the first class
belong the Dukes and Counts of <i>Burgundy</i>, <i>Aquitaine</i>,
<i>Toulouse</i>, and <i>Flanders</i>; to the second the Counts of
<i>Anjou</i>, <i>Chartres</i>, and <i>Champagne</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Special character
of
Normandy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Historically, <i>Normandy</i>
belongs to the second class, as the original
grant to Rolf was undoubtedly cut off from the French
duchy. But the whole circumstances of the Norman
duchy made it a truly national state, owing to the
French crown the merest external homage.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Britanny.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Britanny</i>,
yet more distinct in every way, was held to owe its
immediate homage to the Duke of the Normans.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Twelve
Peers.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
so-called Twelve Peers of France seem to have been
devised by Philip Augustus out of the romances of
Charlemagne; but the selection shows who were looked
on as the greatest vassals of the crown in his day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
six lay peers were the Dukes of Burgundy, Normandy,
and Aquitaine, the Counts of Flanders, Toulouse, and
Champagne.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Champagne.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last was the only one of the six who
could not be looked upon as a national sovereign. His
dominions were <i>French</i> in a sense in which Normandy
or Aquitaine could not be called French.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Different
position of
the Bishops
in the Eastern
and
Western
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The six
ecclesiastical peers offer a marked contrast to the
ecclesiastical electors of the Empire. The German
bishops became princes, holding directly of the Empire.
But the bishops within the dominions of the great
vassals of the French crown were the subjects of
their immediate sovereigns. The Archbishop of Rouen
or the Archbishop of Bourdeaux stood in no relation
to the King of the French. The ecclesiastical peerage
of France consisted only of certain bishops who were
immediate vassals of the King in his character of King,
among whom was only one prelate of the first rank,
the Archbishop and Duke of <i>Rheims</i>. The others were
the Bishops and Dukes of <i>Langres</i> and <i>Laon</i>, and the
Bishops and Counts of <i>Beauvais</i>, <i>Noyon</i>, and <i>Châlons</i>.
As the bishops within the dominions of the great feudatories
had no claim to rank as peers of the kingdom,
neither had those prelates who were actually within
the King’s immediate territory, vassals therefore of the
Duke of the French as well as of the King. Thus the
Bishop of <i>Paris</i> and his metropolitan the Archbishop
of <i>Sens</i> had no place among the twelve peers.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>Incorporation of the Vassal States.</i></h3>

<p>At the accession of the Parisian dynasty, the royal
domain took in the greater part of the later <i>Isle of
France</i>, the territory to which the old name specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
clung, the greater part of the later government of <i>Orleans</i>,
besides some outlying fiefs holding immediately
of the King.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Chief vassals
within
the royal
domain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Within this territory the counties of
<i>Clermont</i>, <i>Dreux</i>, <i>Moulins</i>, <i>Valois</i>, and <i>Gatinois</i>, are
of the greatest historical importance. Two of the great
rivers of Gaul, the Seine and the Loire, flowed through
the royal dominions; but the King was wholly cut off
from the sea by the great feudatories who commanded
the lower course of the rivers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>States on
the Channel
and<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The coast of the channel
was held by the princes of Britanny, Normandy,
and Flanders, and the smaller county of <i>Ponthieu</i>,
which lay between Normandy and Flanders and fluctuated
in its homage between the two.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>on the
Ocean;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The ocean
coast was held by the rulers of Britanny, of <i>Poitou</i>
and <i>Aquitaine</i> united under a single sovereign, and
of <i>Gascony</i> to the south of them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>on the
Mediterranean
coast.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
That small part of
the Mediterranean coast which nominally belonged
to the Western Kingdom was held by the counts of
<i>Toulouse</i> and <i>Barcelona</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neighbours
of the royal
domain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of these great feudatories, the
princes of Flanders, Burgundy, Normandy, and Champagne,
were all immediate neighbours of the King. To
the west of the royal domain lay several states of the
second rank which played a great part in the history
of France and Normandy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Chartres
and Blois.
1125-1152.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were the counties
of <i>Chartres</i> and <i>Blois</i>, which were for a while
united with <i>Champagne</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Anjou and
Touraine

1044.<br />
Maine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Beyond these, besides some
smaller counties, were <i>Anjou</i> and <i>Touraine</i>, and <i>Maine</i>,
the great borderland of Normandy and France. Thus
surrounded by their own vassals, the early Kings of
the house of Paris had far less dealings with powers
beyond their own kingdom than their Karolingian
predecessors. They were thus able to make themselves
the great power of Gaul before they stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
forth on a wider field as one of the great powers of
Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The kingdom
smaller
than the
old duchy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>As regards their extent of territory, the Kings of
the French at the beginning of the eleventh century
had altogether fallen away from the commanding
position which had been held by the Dukes of the
French in the middle of the tenth. But this seeming
loss of power was fully outweighed by the fact that
there were now Kings and not merely Dukes, lords
and no longer vassals.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advantage
of the
kingly
position.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As feudal principles grew,
opportunities were constantly found for annexing the
lands of the vassal to the lands of his lord.

Towards
the end of the eleventh century the royal domain had
already begun to increase by the acquisition of the
<i>Gatinois</i> and of the viscounty of <i>Bourges</i>, a small part
only of the later province of Berry, but an addition
which made France and Aquitaine more clearly neighbours
than before. Towards the end of the twelfth
century began a more important advance to the north-east.
The first aggrandizement of France at the expense
of Flanders was the beginning of an important
chain of events in European history.

county of <i>Valois</i> two years later.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Artois.
1180-1187.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
So for a while was
the more important land of <i>Artois</i>. Later in the reign
of the same prince came an annexation on a far
greater scale, which did not happen till the first years
of the thirteenth century, but which was the result of
causes which had been going on ever since the
eleventh.</p>

<p>In the course of the twelfth century a power

which in extent of territory threw the dominions of
the French King into insignificance. The two great
powers of northern and southern Gaul, Normandy and
Aquitaine, each carrying with it a crowd of smaller
states, were united in the hands of a single prince, and
that a prince who was also the king of a powerful
foreign kingdom. The Aquitanian duchy contained,
besides the county of <i>Poitou</i>, a number of fiefs, of
which the most important were those of <i>Perigueux</i>,
<i>Limoges</i>, the dauphiny of <i>Auvergne</i>, and the county of
<i>Marche</i> which gave kings to Jerusalem and Cyprus.

southern duchy from the kingdom, and united the
great powers of northern and southern Gaul. Then
their common lord won a crown beyond the sea and
became the first Angevin king of England.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Britanny.

Another
marriage brought Britanny, long the nominal fief of
Normandy, under the practical dominion of its Duke.
The House of Anjou thus suddenly rose to a dominion
on Gaulish soil equal to that of the French king and
his other vassals put together, a dominion which held
the mouths of the three great rivers, and which was
further strengthened by the possession of the English
kingdom. But a favourable moment soon came which
enabled the King to add to his own dominions the
greater part of the estates of his dangerous vassal.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Claims of

On the death of Richard, first of England and fourth

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Possible

The success of
Arthur would have given the geography of Gaul altogether
a new shape. The Angevin possessions on the
continent, instead of being held by a king of England,
would have been held by a Duke of Britanny, the
prince of a state which, though not geographically cut
off like England, was even more foreign to France.

On the fall of Arthur, Philip, by the help of a jurisprudence
devised for the purpose, was able to declare
all the fiefs which John held of the French crown to
be forfeited to that crown, a sentence which did not
apply to the fiefs of his mother Eleanor. In the
space of two years Philip was able to carry that
sentence into effect everywhere on the mainland.

Aquitaine was now no
longer part of the continental dominions of a prince
who was equally at home on both sides of the Channel.
It was now a remote dependency of the insular kingdom,
a dependency whose great cities clave to the
English connexion, while its geographical position and
the feelings of its feudal nobility tended to draw it
towards France.</p>

<p class="pb2">The result of this great and sudden acquisition of
territory was to make the King of the French incomparably
greater on Gaulish ground than any of his
own vassals. France had now a large sea-board on
the Channel and a small sea-board on the Ocean. And
now another chain of events incorporated a large territory
with which the crown had hitherto stood in no
practical relation, and which gave the kingdom a third
sea-board on the Mediterranean.</p>

this region had been the counts of <i>Toulouse</i>, who,

in the Burgundian kingdom beyond the Rhone.
But during the latter part of the eleventh century and
the beginning of the twelfth, the Counts of <i>Barcelona</i>,
and the kings of Aragon who succeeded them, acquired
by various means a number of Tolosan fiefs,
both French and Imperial. <i>Carcassonne</i>, <i>Albi</i>, and

<p class="pb2">Thus, during the reigns of Philip Augustus and his

the annexations of two of the chief vassal states, two of
the lay peerages, annexations which gave the French

had for two generations been united with the kingdom
of Navarre. These dominions were held in right of

Then Navarre,
though it passed to a French prince, was wholly
separated from France, while Champagne was incorporated
with the kingdom. This last annexation gave
France a considerable frontier towards Germany, and
especially brought the kingdom into the immediate
neighbourhood of the Lotharingian bishoprics. These
acquisitions, of Normandy and the states connected
with it, of Toulouse and the rest of Languedoc, and
now of Champagne, were the chief cases of incorporation
of vassal states with the royal domain up to
the middle of the fourteenth century.

The mere grants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>

We now turn to two great struggles which, in the
course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the
Kings of France had to wage with two of their chief
vassals who were also powerful foreign princes. In
both cases, events which seemed likely to bring about
the utter humiliation of France did in the end bring
to it a large increase of territory.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Hundred
Years’
War with
England.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">The former of these struggles was the great war
between England and France, called by French writers
the <i>Hundred Years’ War</i>. This war might be called
either a war for the annexation of France to England
or a war for the annexation of Aquitaine to France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Designs of
the French
kings on
Aquitaine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By the peace between Henry the Third and Saint
Lewis, Aquitaine became a land held by the king
of England as a vassal of the French crown. From
that time it was one main object of the French kings
to change their feudal superiority over this great
duchy into an actual possession. This object had been
once obtained for a moment by the marriage of
Eleanor and Lewis the Seventh.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Momentary
occupation
by Philip
the Fair.
1294.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was again obtained
for a moment by the negotiations between Edward the
First and Philip the Fair. The Hundred Years’ war
began through the attempts of Philip of Valois on the
Aquitanian dominions of Edward the Third.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1337.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then
the King of England found it politic to assume the title
of King of France.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1339.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the real nature of the controversy
was shown by the first great settlement.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Peace of
Bretigny.
1360.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At
the Peace of <i>Bretigny</i> Edward gave up all claim
to the crown of France, in exchange for the independent
sovereignty of his old fiefs and of some of his recent
conquests. <i>Aquitaine</i> and <i>Gascony</i>, including <i>Poitou</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
but not including <i>Auvergne</i>, together with the districts
on the Channel, <i>Calais</i> with <i>Guines</i> and the county of
<i>Ponthieu</i>, were made over to the King of England without
the reservation of any homage or superiority of any
kind. These lands became a territory as foreign to
the French kingdom as the territory of her German
and Spanish neighbours.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Renewal of

Losses of
the English.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But in a few years the treaty
was broken on the French side, and the actual possessions
of England beyond the sea were cut down to
Calais and Guines, with some small parts of Aquitaine
adjoining the cities of Bourdeaux and Bayonne.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests

The

Paris saw the crowning of an English king, and only
the central part of the country obeyed the heir of
the Parisian kingdom, no longer king of Paris but
only of Bourges.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
Aquitaine.
1451-1453.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the final result of the war
was the driving out of the English from all Aquitaine
and France, except the single district of Calais. The
geographical aspect of the change is that Aquitaine,
which had been wholly cut off from the kingdom by
the Peace of Bretigny, was finally incorporated with
the kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Final union
of Aquitaine
with
France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The French conquest of Aquitaine, the
result of the Hundred Years’ War, was in form the
conquest of a land which had ceased to stand in any
relation to the French crown. Practically it was the
incorporation with the French crown of its greatest
fief, balanced by the loss of a small territory the value
of which was certainly out of all proportion to its geographical
extent. In its historical aspect the annexation
of Aquitaine was something yet more. The first foreshadowing
of the modern French kingdom was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
by the addition of Aquitaine to Neustria, of southern
to northern Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Now, after so many strivings,
the two were united for ever. Aquitaine was merged
in France. The grant to Charles the Bald took effect
after six hundred years.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning

France, in the sense which

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of

<p>Thus, in the course of somewhat less than four
hundred years, the conquest of England by a vassal of
France, followed by the union of a crowd of other French
fiefs in the hands of a common sovereign of England
and Normandy, had led to the union with France of all
the continental possessions of the prince who thus
reigned on both sides of the sea. Meanwhile, on the
eastern side of the kingdom, the holder of a great French
fief swelled into an European power, the special rival of
his French overlord.

The duchy of <i>Burgundy</i> with the county of <i>Charolois</i>,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>French advance

This was the addition of a territory which the kings of
France had never before ruled, and it marks an important
stage in the advance of the French power
towards the Imperial lands on its eastern border. By
the marriage of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian of
Austria, the remains of the Burgundian dominions
passed to the House of Austria, and thereby in the
end to Spain. The result was that a French king had
for a moment an Emperor for his vassal in his character
of Count of Flanders and Artois.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Flanders

But by the treaty of
Madrid Flanders and Artois were relieved from all
homage to France, exactly as Aquitaine had been by
the Peace of Bretigny. They now became lands wholly
foreign to France, and, as foreign lands, large parts of
them were afterwards conquered by France, just as
Aquitaine was. But the history of their acquisition
belongs to the story of the advance of France at the
expense of the Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>All the

<p>Thus, by the end of the reign of Lewis the Eleventh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
all the fiefs of the French crown which could make
any claim to the character of separate sovereignties
had, with a single exception, been added to the dominions
of the crown. The one which had escaped was
that one which, more than any other, represented a
nationality altogether distinct from that of France.
<i>Britanny</i> still remained distinct under its own Dukes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1491-1499;

The marriages of its Duchess Anne with two successive
French kings, Charles the Eighth and Lewis the
Twelfth, added Britanny to France, and so completed
the work. The whole of the Western Kingdom,
except those parts which had become foreign ground—that
is to say, insular Normandy and Calais, Barcelona,
Flanders, and Artois—was now united under the
kings of Paris. Their duchy of <i>France</i> had spread its
power and its name over the whole kingdom. We
have now to see how it also spread itself over lands
which had never formed part of that kingdom.</p>

kingdoms to the south.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>England.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The union of Normandy and
England in some sort made England and France immediate
neighbours. And the long retention of Aquitaine
by England, the English possession of Calais for more
than two hundred years and of the insular Normandy
down to our own day, have all tended to keep them
so.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Small acquisitions

But the acquisitions of France from England, and
from Spain, in its character as Spain, have been comparatively
small. Indeed the separation of the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
March and the insular Normandy may be thought
to turn the balance the other way. From England
France has won Aquitaine and Calais, territories which
had once been under the homage of the French King.

So in the sixteenth century <i>Boulogne</i> was lost to
England and won back again; so in the seventeenth
century <i>Dunkirk</i>, which had become an English possession,
was made over to France. Since the final loss
of Aquitaine, the wars between England and France
have made most important changes in the English and
French possessions in distant parts of the world, but
they have had no effect on the geography of England,
and very little on that of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Boundary

<p class="pb2">Nearly the same may be said of the geographical
relations between France and Spain. The long wars
between those countries have added to France a large
part of the outlying dominions of Spain; but they
have not greatly affected the boundaries of the two
countries themselves.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Roussillon,

United
to France by Lewis the Eleventh, given back by
Charles the Eighth, it was finally annexed to France
by the Peace of the Pyrenees. Towards the other end

territory has been annexed to France, perhaps quite
unconsciously.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Navarre

crown of France passed to a King of Navarre who
held only the part of his kingdom north of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>

On the other

The north-eastern
frontier of the Western Kingdom changed but
little from the accession of the Parisian house in the
tenth century till the growth of the Dukes of Burgundy
in the fifteenth. After Lotharingia finally
became a part of the Eastern Kingdom, there was no
doubt that the homage of Flanders was due to France,
no doubt that the homage of the states which had
formed the Lower Lotharingia was due to the Empire.
The frontier towards the Upper Lotharingia and the
Burgundian county also remained untouched. The
Saône remained a boundary stream long after the
Rhone had ceased to be one.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of

It was on this latter

Add to this that, though France
and the Confederate territory did not yet actually touch,
yet the Burgundian wars and many other events in the
latter half of the fifteenth century enabled France to
establish a close connexion with the power which
had grown up north of Lake Leman. France had
thus become a great Mediterranean and Alpine power,
ready to threaten Italy in the next generation. Later
acquisitions within the old border of the Burgundian

going on that the French kings added to their dominions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
the Aquitanian lands on one side and the Burgundian
duchy on the other. The acquisition of
Aquitaine has, besides its other characters, a third
aspect which closely connects it with the annexations
between the Rhone and the Alps.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of
French annexations
on the
<i>Langue
d’oc</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The strife between
Northern and Southern Gaul, between the tongue
of <i>oil</i> and the tongue of <i>oc</i>, now came to an end.
Had the chief power in Gaul settled somewhere in
Burgundy or Aquitaine, the tongue of <i>oil</i> might now
pass for a <i>patois</i> of the tongue of <i>oc</i>. Had French
dominion in Italy begun as soon and lasted as permanently
as French dominion in Burgundy and
Aquitaine, the tongue of <i>si</i>, as well as the tongue of <i>oc</i>,
might now pass for a <i>patois</i> of the tongue of <i>oil</i>. But
now it was settled that French, not Provençal, was to
be the ruling speech of Gaul. The lands of the
Southern speech which escaped were almost wholly
portions of the dominions of other powers. There
was no longer any separate state wholly of that
speech, except the little principality of Orange.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extinction
of the Provençal
speech and
nation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
work which the French kings had now ended amounted
to little short of the extinction of an European nation.
A tongue, once of at least equal dignity with the tongue
of Paris and Tours, has sunk from the rank of a
national language to the rank of a provincial dialect.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Italian
conquests
of France.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">The next great conquests of France were made on
Italian soil, but they are conquests which do not greatly
concern geography. This distinguishes the relations
of France towards Italy from her relations towards
Burgundy. France has constantly interfered in Italian
affairs; she has at various times held large Italian
territories, and brought all Italy under French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
influence. But France has never permanently kept any
large amount of Italian territory. The French possession
of Naples and Milan was only temporary.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Not strictly
extensions
of France.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And,
if it had been lasting, the possession of these isolated
territories by the French king could hardly have been
looked on as an extension of the actual French
frontier. Those lands could never have been incorporated
with France in the same way in which other
French conquests had been. Their retention would
in truth have given the later history of France quite
a different character, a character more like that which
actually belonged to Spain. The long occupation of
Savoyard territory on both sides of the Alps<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> would, if
it had lasted, have been a real extension of the French
kingdom. But down to our own day, while the lands
won by France from the Burgundian kingdom form a
large proportion of the whole French territory, French
acquisitions from Italy hardly go beyond the island
of Corsica and the insignificant district of <i>Mentone</i>.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexations
at the
expense of
Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The great annexations of France at the expense of
the German kingdom and the lands more closely connected
with it begin in the middle of the sixteenth
century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation
of
Metz, Toul,
and Verdun.
1552.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first great advance was the practical
annexation of the three Lotharingian bishoprics, though
their separation from the Empire was not formally
acknowledged till the Peace of Westfalia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of
isolated
conquests.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This kind
of conquest can hardly fail to lead to other conquests.
France now held certain patches of territory
which lay detached from one another and from the
main body of the kingdom. Yet the rounding off
of the frontier was not the next step taken in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
direction. The cause was most likely the close connexion
which for somewhile existed between the ruling
houses of France and Lorraine.</p>

<p>Before the next French advance on German ground,
the frontier had been extended in other directions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovery
of Calais,
1558;<br />
of Boulogne,
1550.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Almost at the same time as the acquisition of the Three
Bishoprics, <i>Calais</i> was won back from England—the
short English possession of <i>Boulogne</i> had already come
to an end.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Surrender

and annexation
of
Bresse,
Bugey, and
Gex.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

saw the surrender of <i>Saluzzo</i>, in exchange for <i>Bresse</i>,
<i>Bugey</i>, and <i>Gex</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Occupation
of Pinerolo.
1630-1696.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thirty years later came the renewed
occupation of Italian territory at <i>Pinerolo</i> and other
points in Piedmont, which lasted till nearly the end of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The next great advance was the work of the Thirty
Years’ War and of the war with Spain which went on
for eleven years longer.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Bishoprics
surrendered
by the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Now came the legal cession
of the Bishoprics and the further acquisition of the
Alsatian dominions and rights of the House of Austria.
The irregularities of the frontier, and the temptation
to round off its angles, were increased tenfold.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>French acquisitions
in Elsass.
1648.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
France
received another and larger isolated territory lying to
the east both of her earlier conquests and of the independent
lands which surrounded them. A part of
her dominion, itself sprinkled with isolated towns and
districts which did not belong to her dominion, stretched
out without any connexion into the middle of the
Empire. The Duchy of Lorraine, dotted over by the
French lands of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, lay between
the old French land of Champagne and the new French
land of <i>Elsass</i> or <i>Alsace</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Breisach.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And while France was allowed,
by the possession of <i>Breisach</i>, to establish herself at one
point on the right bank of the Rhine, her new territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
on the left bank was broken up by the continued independence
of <i>Strassburg</i> and the other Alsatian towns
and districts which were still left to the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>France
reaches the
Rhine.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Such
a frontier could hardly be lasting; now that France
had reached and even crossed the Rhine, the annexation
of the outlying Imperial lands to the west of that river
was sure to follow.</p>

<p>But, even after this further advance into the heart
of Germany, the gap was not filled up at the next
stage of annexation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation
of Bar.
1659.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the Peace of the Pyrenees,
France obtained the scattered lands of the duchy of
Bar, which made the greater part of the Three
Bishoprics continuous with her older possessions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bar restored.
1661.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
Bar was presently restored, and, though Lorraine was
constantly occupied by French armies, it was not incorporated
with France for another century. Up to
this last change the Three Bishoprics still remained
isolated French possessions surrounded by lands of
the Empire. But France advanced at the expense of
the outlying possessions of Spain, lands only nominally
Imperial, as well as of the Spanish lands on her own
southern frontier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation
of
Roussillon.
1659.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the Peace of the Pyrenees
<i>Roussillon</i> finally became French. No Spanish kingdom
any longer stretched north of the great natural
barrier of the peninsula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexation
in the
Netherlands.
1659.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The same Treaty gave
France her first acquisitions in <i>Flanders</i> and <i>Artois</i>
since they had become wholly foreign ground, as well
as her first acquisitions from <i>Hainault</i>, <i>Liége</i>, and
<i>Luxemburg</i>, lands which had never owed her homage.
Here again the frontier was of the same kind as the
frontier towards Germany.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Isolated

by each

Isolated points like <i>Philippeville</i>

<i>Aire</i> and <i>St. Omer</i> were still held by Spain in what
had now become French territory.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Further annexations.
1668.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The furthest
French advance that was recognized by any treaty
was made by the earlier Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
when, amongst other places, <i>Douay</i>, <i>Tournay</i>, <i>Lille</i>,
<i>Oudenarde</i>, and <i>Courtray</i> became French.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes at
the Peace of
Nimwegen.
1678.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By the
Peace of Nimwegen the frontier again fell back in
eastern Flanders, and Courtray and Oudenarde were
restored. But in the districts more to the south
France again advanced, gaining the outlying Spanish
towns in Artois, <i>Cambray</i> and its district, and <i>Valenciennes</i>
in Hainault.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1697.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Peace of Ryswick left the
frontier as it had been fixed by the Peace of Nimwegen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Treaty of
Utrecht
and Barrier
Treaty.
1713-1715.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Finally, the Treaty of Utrecht and the Barrier Treaty
left France in possession of a considerable part of
Flanders, and of much land which had been Imperial.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Barrier
Towns.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Netherlands, formerly Spanish and now Austrian,
kept a frontier protected by the barrier towns of <i>Furnes</i>,
<i>Ypres</i>, <i>Menin</i>, <i>Tournai</i>, <i>Mons</i>, <i>Charleroi</i>, <i>Namur</i>. The
French frontier on the other side had its series of
barrier towns stretching from <i>St. Omer</i> to <i>Charlemont</i>
on the Maes. The arrangements now made have,
with very slight changes, lasted ever since, except
during the French annexation of the whole of the
Netherlands during the revolutionary wars.</p>

<p>The reign of Lewis the Fourteenth was also a time
of at least equal advance on the part of France on
her more strictly German frontier. The time was now
come for serious attempts to consolidate the scattered
possessions of France between Champagne and the
Rhine.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Franche

<i>Franche Comté</i>, as the county of Burgundy was

was twice seized by Lewis, and the second seizure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
was confirmed by the peace of Nimwegen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Freiburg.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By that
peace also France kept <i>Freiburg-im-Breisgau</i> on the
right bank of the Rhine. A number of small places
in Elsass were annexed after the peace of Nimwegen
by the process known as <i>Reunion</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Seizure of

the peace of Ryswick.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Restoration

But Freiburg and Breisach

In the same
year the principality of <i>Orange</i> was annexed to
France, leaving the Papal possessions of Avignon
and Venaissin surrounded by French territory, the
last relic of the Burgundian realm between the Rhone
and the Alps.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
the reign of
Lewis the
Fourteenth.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
France had thus obtained a good
physical boundary towards Spain and Italy, and a
boundary clearly marked on the map towards the
now Austrian Netherlands. Her eastern frontier was
still broken in upon by the duchy of Lorraine, by
the districts in Elsass which had still escaped, by
the county of <i>Montbeliard</i>, and by the detached territories
of the commonwealth of <i>Geneva</i>. But France
could now in a certain part of her territory call
the Rhine her frontier. It was an easy inference that
the Rhine ought to be her frontier through the whole
of its course.</p>


<p class="p2">The next reign, that of Lewis the Fifteenth,
in a manner completed the work of Henry the
Second and Lewis the Fourteenth. The gap which
had so long yawned between Champagne and Elsass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
was now filled up.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrangements
as to
Lorraine.
1735.<br />
Its incorporation.
1766.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
France obtained a reversionary
right to the duchy of Lorraine, which was incorporated
thirty-one years later. The lands of Metz, Toul, and
Verdun were no longer isolated. Elsass, which, by the
acquisition of Franche Comté, had ceased to be insular,
now ceased to be even peninsular. Leaving out of
sight a few spots of Imperial soil which were now
wholly surrounded by France, the French territory
now stretched as a solid and unbroken mass from the
Ocean to the Rhine.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thorough
incorporation
of
French
Conquests.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And it must be remembered that
all the lands which the monarchy of Paris had gradually
brought under its power were in the strictest
sense incorporated with the kingdom. There were
no dependencies, no separate kingdoms or duchies.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of
geographical
continuity.<br />
Contrast
with Spain
and Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The geographical continuity of the French territory
enabled France really to incorporate her conquests
in a way in which Spain and Austria never could.
And the process was further helped by the fact that
each annexation by itself was small compared with the
general bulk of the French monarchy. Except in the
case of the fragment of Navarre which was held by its
Bourbon king, France never annexed a kingdom or
made any permanent addition to the royal style of her
kings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Purchase of
Corsica.
1768.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The same reign saw another acquisition altogether
unlike the rest in the form of the Italian island
of <i>Corsica</i>. In itself the incorporation of this island
with the French kingdom seems as unnatural as
the Spanish or Austrian dominion in Sicily or Sardinia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its effects.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the result has been different. Corsica has
been far more thoroughly incorporated with France
than such outlying possessions commonly are. The
truth is that the strong continuity of the continental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
dominions of France made the incorporation of the
island easier. There were no traditions or precedents
which could suggest the holding of it as a dependency
or as a separate state in any form.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Birth of
Buonaparte.
1769.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Corsica again was
more easily attached to France, because the man who
did most to extend the dominion of France was a
Frenchman only so far as Corsicans had become Frenchmen.
Corsica has thus become French in a sense in
which Sardinia and Sicily never became Spanish, partly
because France had no other possession of the kind,
partly because Napoleon Buonaparte was born at
Ajaccio.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>The Colonial Dominion of France.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Early
French colonization.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>France, like all the European powers which have
an oceanic coast, entered early on the field of colonization
and distant dominion. At one time indeed it
seemed as if France was destined to become the chief
European power both in India and in North America.

Thus <i>Cape
Breton</i> at the mouth of the Saint Lawrence was

in America was confirmed by the foundation of
<i>Quebec</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acadia

Great Britain, till it was finally surrendered by France
at the Peace of Utrecht.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Canada and
Louisiana.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
France now, under the

held or claimed a vast inland region stretching from
the mouth of the Saint Lawrence to the mouth of the
Mississippi, while the eastern coast was colonized by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>

The Mississippi was now made the boundary

ruled for ever that men of English blood, whether
remaining subjects of the mother-country or forming
independent states, should be the dominant power in
the North American continent.</p>

commercial settlements grew into dominion, or what

<h3>§ 4. <i>Acquisitions of France during the Revolutionary Wars.</i></h3>

<p>Thus the French monarchy grew from the original
Parisian duchy into a kingdom which spread north,
south, east, and west, taking in all the fiefs of the West-Frankish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
kings, together with much which had belonged
to the other kingdoms of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisitions
in the
Revolutionary
Wars.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
With
the great French revolution began a series of acquisitions
of territory on the part of France which are altogether
unparalleled.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Different
classes of
annexations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
First of all, there were those
small annexations of territory surrounded or nearly so
by French territory, whose annexation was necessary
if French territory was to be continuous.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Avignon.<br />
Mülhausen.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Such were
Avignon, Venaissin, the county of <i>Montbeliard</i>, the few
points in Elsass which had escaped the reunions, with
the Confederate city of <i>Mülhausen</i>. Avignon and Venaissin,
and the surviving Alsatian fragments, were annexed
to France before the time of warfare and conquest
had begun. Mülhausen, as Confederate ground, was
respected as long as Confederate ground was respected.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1796.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Montbeliard had been annexed already.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geneva and
<i>Bischofbasel</i>.

And with
these we might be inclined to place the annexations of
Geneva and of the <i>Bishopric of Basel</i>, lands which lay
hardly less temptingly when the work of annexation had
once begun.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second

And beyond these roundings off of the
home estate lay a zone of territory which might easily
be looked upon as being French soil wrongfully lost.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>traditions
of Gaul and
the Rhine
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
When the Western <i>Francia</i> had made such great strides
towards the dimensions of the Gaul of Cæsar, the inference
was easily made that it ought to take in all that
Gaul had once taken in. The conquest and incorporation
of the Austrian Netherlands, of all Germany on
the left bank of the Rhine, of Savoy and Nizza, thus
became a matter of course.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Buonaparte’s
feeling
towards
Switzerland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
That the Gaul of Cæsar
was not fully completed by the complete incorporation
of Switzerland, seems to have been owing to a personal
tenderness for the Confederation on the part of
Napoleon Buonaparte, who never incorporated with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
dominions any part of the territory of the Thirteen
Cantons. Otherwise, France under the Consulate might
pass for a revival of the Transalpine Gaul of Roman
geography. And there were other lands beyond the
borders of Transalpine Gaul, which had formed part
of Gaul in the earlier sense of the name, and whose
annexation, when annexation had once begun, was
hardly less wonderful than that of the lands within the
Rhine and the Alps.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Piedmont,
&amp;c.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The incorporation of Piedmont
and Genoa was not wonderful after the incorporation of
Savoy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distinction
between
conquests
under the
Republic
and under
the ‘Empire.’<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In short, the annexations of republican France
are at least intelligible. They have a meaning; we
can follow their purpose and object. They stand
distinct from the wild schemes of universal conquest
which mark the period of the ‘Empire.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Example of
Corsica.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Still the example of such schemes was given during
the days of the old monarchy. There was nothing to
suggest a French annexation of Corsica, any more than
a French annexation of Cerigo.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
of Buonaparte’s
conquests.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Both were works of
exactly the kind, works quite different from incorporating
isolated scraps of Elsass or of the old Burgundy,
from rounding off the frontier by Montbeliard, or even
from advancing to the left bank of the Rhine. The
shiftings of the map which took place during the ten
years of the first French Empire, the divisions and the
unions, the different relations of the conquered states,
seem like several centuries of the onward march of
the old Roman commonwealth crowded into a single
day.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dependent
and incorporated
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In both cases we mark the distinction between
lands which are merely dependent and lands which are
fully incorporated. And in both cases the dependent
relation is commonly a step towards full incorporation.
All past history and tradition, all national feelings, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
distinctions of race and language, were despised in
building up the vast fabric of French dominion. Such
a power was sure to break in pieces, even without
any foreign attack, before its parts could possibly have
been fused together. As it was, Buonaparte never
professed to incorporate either Spain or the whole of
Italy and Germany with his Empire. He was satisfied
with leaving large parts either in the formally
dependent relation, in the hands of puppet princes,
or even in the hands of powers which he deemed
too much weakened for further resistance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Buonaparte’s
treatment
of Germany;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A large
part of Germany was incorporated with France, another
large part was under French protection or dependence,
but a large part still remained in the hands of the
native princes of Austria and Prussia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Much of Italy
was incorporated, and the rest was held, partly by
the conqueror himself under another title, partly by
a prince of his own house. This last was the case with
Spain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division of
Europe between
France and
Russia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Till the final breach with Russia, the idea of
Buonaparte’s dominion seems to have been that of
a twofold division of Europe between Russia and himself,
a kind of revival on a vaster scale of the Eastern
and Western Empires. The western potentate was
careful to keep everywhere a dominant influence within
his own world; but whether the territory should be
incorporated, made dependent, or granted out to his
kinsfolk and favourites, depended in each case on the
conqueror’s will.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Europe in
1811.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A glance at the map of Europe, as it stood at the
beginning of 1811, will show how nearly this scheme
was carried out. The kernel of the French Empire
was France as it stood at the beginning of the Revolution,
together with those conquests of the Republic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
which gave it the Rhine frontier from Basel to Nimwegen.
Beyond these limits the former United Provinces,
with the whole oceanic coast of Germany as
far as the Elbe, and the cities of Bremen, Hamburg,
and Lübeck, were incorporated with France. France
now stretched to the Baltic, and, as Holstein was now
incorporated with Denmark, France and Denmark had
a common frontier. The Confederation of the Rhine
was a protected state, and the Kingdom of Prussia and
the self-styled ‘Empire’ of Austria could practically
hardly claim a higher place. Of the former Austrian
possessions, those parts which had passed to Bavaria
and to the kingdom of Italy formally stood in the dependent
relation, and the so-called Illyrian provinces
were actually incorporated with France. So were the
Ionian islands yet further on. In Italy, the whole
western side of the ancient kingdom, with Rome itself,
was incorporated with France. North-eastern Italy
formed a separate kingdom held by the ruler of
France. Naples, like Spain, was a dependent kingdom.
In northern Europe, Denmark and Sweden, like Prussia
and Austria, could practically claim no higher place.
And the new duchy of Warsaw and the new republic
of Danzig carried French influence beyond the ancient
borders of Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrangements
of
1814-1815.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Such was the extent of the French dominion when
the power of Buonaparte was at its highest. At his fall
all the great and distant conquests were given up.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The first
class of annexations
retained by
France,
the rest

But
those annexations which were necessary for the completion
of France as she then stood were respected.
The new Germanic body took back Köln, Trier, and
Mainz, Worms and Speyer, but not Montbeliard or
any part of Elsass. The new Swiss body received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
Bishopric of Basel, Neufchâtel, Geneva, and Wallis.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Boundary
of Savoy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Savoy and Nizza went back to their own prince. But
here a different frontier was drawn after the first and
the second fall of Buonaparte. The earlier arrangement
left Chambéry to France. The Pope again received
Rome and his Italian dominions, but not his outlying
Burgundian city of Avignon and county of Venaissin.
The frontier of the new kingdom of the Netherlands,
though traced at slightly different points by the two
arrangements, differed in either case but little from the
frontier of the Barrier Treaty. In short the France of the
restored Bourbons was the France of the old Bourbons,
enlarged by those small isolated scraps of foreign soil
which were needed to make it continuous.</p>

<p>The geographical results of the rule of the second
Buonaparte consist of the completion of the work which
began under Philip the Fair, balanced by the utter undoing
of the work of Richelieu, the partial undoing of
the work of Henry the Second and Lewis the Fourteenth.

The greatest West India colony

home example by taking the title of Emperor.
About the same time the last remnant of French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
dominion on the North American continent was voluntarily
given up.

<p>But since France was thus wholly beaten back

and colonization which has no exact parallel in
modern times.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character

It is the winning
back from Islam of a land which once was part of
Latin-speaking Christendom, a conquest which, except
in the necessary points of difference between continental
and insular conquests, may be best paralleled with the
Norman Conquest of Sicily. Sicily could be wholly
recovered for Europe and Christendom; but the French
settlement in Algeria can never be more than a mere
fringe of Europe and its civilization on the edge of
barbaric Africa. It is strictly the first colony of the
kind. Portugal, Spain, England, had occupied this or
that point on the northern coast of Africa; France was
the first European power to spread her dominion over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
long range of the southern Mediterranean shore, a land
which in some sort answers alike to India and to Australia,
but lying within two days’ sail of her own coast.</p>


<p class="p2">We have thus finished our survey of the states
which were formed out of the break-up of the later
Western Empire. The rest of Western Europe must
be postponed, as neither the Spanish, the British, nor
the Scandinavian kingdoms rose out of the break-up
of the Empire of Charles the Great. In our next
Chapter we must trace the historical geography of the
states which arose out of the gradual dismemberment
of the dominion of the Eastern Rome, a survey which
will lead us to the most stirring events and to the latest
geographical changes of our own day.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE EASTERN EMPIRE.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Contrast
between the
Eastern and
Western
Empires.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> geographical, like the political, history of the
Eastern Empire is wholly unlike that of the Western.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Western
Empire fell
to pieces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Western Empire, in the strictest sense, fell asunder.
Some of its parts fell away formally, others practically.
The tie that held the rest snapped at the first touch of
a vigorous invader. But that invader was an European
power whose territories had once formed part of the
Empire itself. From the invasions of nations beyond
the European pale the Western Empire, as such, suffered
but little. The Western Empire again, long
before its fall, had become, so far as it was a power
at all, a national power, the <i>Roman Empire of the
German nation</i>. Its fall was the half voluntary parting
asunder of a nation as well as of an Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position
of the
Western
Emperors;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Western Emperors again had, as Emperors, practically
ceased to be territorial princes. No lands of any account
directly obeyed the Emperor, as such, as their
immediate sovereign. When the Empire fell, the
Emperor withdrew to his hereditary states, taking the
Imperial title with him. In the Eastern Empire all is
different. It did to some extent fall asunder from
within, but its overthrow was mainly owing to its being
broken in pieces from without.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of the
Eastern.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, throughout its
history, the Emperor remained the immediate sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
of all that still clave to the Empire, and, when the
Empire fell, the Emperor fell with it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern
Empire fell
mainly
through
foreign
invasion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The overthrow
of the Empire was mainly owing to foreign invasion
in the strictest sense. It was weakened and dismembered
by the Christian powers of Europe, and at last
swallowed up by the barbarians of Asia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tendencies
to separation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the same
time the tendency to break in pieces after the Western
fashion did exist and must always be borne in mind.
But it existed only in particular parts and under special
conditions. It is found mainly in possessions of the
Empire which had become isolated, in lands which had
been lost and won again, and in lands which came
under the influence of Western ideas. The importance
of these tendencies is shown by the fact that three
powers which had been cut off in various ways from
the body of the Empire, Bulgaria, Venice, and Sicily,
became three of its most dangerous enemies. But the
actual destruction of the Empire came from those barbarian
attacks from which the West suffered but little.</p>

<p>Speaking generally then, the Western Empire fell
asunder from within; the Eastern Empire was broken in
pieces from without. Of the many causes of this difference,
perhaps only one concerns geography. At
the time of the separation of the Empires, the Western
Empire was really only another name for the dominions
of the King of the Franks, whether within or without
the elder Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Closer connexion
of
the East
with
Roman
political
traditions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Eastern Empire, on the other
hand, kept the political tradition of the elder Empire
unbroken.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Disuse of
the Roman
name in
the West.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
No common geographical or national name
took in the three Imperial kingdoms of the West and
their inhabitants.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its retention
in the
East.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But all the inhabitants of the Eastern
Empire, down to the end, knew themselves by no
national name but that of <i>Romans</i>, and the land gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
received the geographical name of <i>Romania</i>. But
the Western Empire was not <i>Romania</i>, nor were its
people <i>Romans</i>. The only <i>Romania</i> in the West, the
Italian land so called, took its name from its long
adhesion to the Eastern Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Importance
of distinctions
of
race in the
East.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the East again differences of race are far more
important than they ever were in the West. In the
West nations have been formed by a certain commingling
of elements; in the East the elements remain
apart. All the nations of the south-eastern peninsula,
whether older than the Roman conquest or settlers of
later times, are there still as distinct nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
original
nations.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>First among them come three nations whose settlement
in the peninsula is older than the Roman conquest.
One of these has kept its name and its language.
One has kept its language, but has taken up
its name afresh only in modern times. The third has
for ages lost both its name and its language.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Albanians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The most
unchanged people in the peninsula must be the <i>Albanians</i>,
called by themselves <i>Skipetar</i>, the representatives
of the old Illyrians.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greeks.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Next come the Greeks, who
keep their language, but whose name of <i>Hellênes</i> went out
of ordinary use till its revival in modern times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Vlachs.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly
there are the <i>Vlachs</i>, representing those inhabitants of
Thrace, Mœsia, and other parts of the peninsula, who, like
the Western nations, exchanged their own speech for
Latin. They must mainly represent the Thracian race in
its widest sense.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
Roman
name.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Both Greeks and Vlachs kept on the
Roman name in different forms, and the Vlachs, the
<i>Roumans</i> of our own day, keep it still. Of the invading
races, the Goths passed through the Empire without
making any lasting settlements in it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slavonic
settlers.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The last Aryan
settlers, setting aside mere colonists in later times, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
the <i>Slaves</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Turanian
settlers.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then came the Turanian settlers, Finnish,
Turkish, or any other. Of these the first wave, the <i>Bulgarians</i>,
were presently assimilated by the Slaves, and
the Bulgarian power must be looked at historically as
Slavonic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Turanian
neighbours.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then come Avars, Chazars, Magyars, Patzinaks,
Cumans, all settling on or near the borders
of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Magyars.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of these the Magyars alone grew into
a lasting European state, and alone established a lasting
power over lands which had formed part of the Empire.
All these invaders came by the way of the lands north of
the Euxine. Lastly, there are the non-Aryan invaders
who came by way of Asia Minor or of the Mediterranean
sea.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Saracens.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Semitic Saracens, after their first conquests
in Syria, Egypt, and Africa, made no lasting conquests.
They occupied for a while several of the great islands;
but on the mainland of the Empire, European and
Asiatic, they were mere plunderers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Seljuk and
Ottoman
Turks.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In their wake
came the most terrible enemies of all, the Turks, first
the Seljuk, then the Ottoman. Ethnologically they
must be grouped with the nations which came in
by the north of the Euxine. Historically, as Mahometans,
coming in by the southern route, they rank
with the Saracens, and they did the work which the
Saracens tried to do. Most of these invading races have
passed away from history; three still remain in three
different stages.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
of
Bulgarians,
Magyars
and Ottomans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Bulgarian is lost among the Aryan
people who have taken his name. The Magyar abides,
keeping his non-Aryan language, but adopted into the
European commonwealth by his acceptance of Christianity.
The Ottoman Turk still abides on European
soil, unchanged because Mahometan, still an alien alike
to the creed and to the tongues of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Eastern
Empire
becomes
Greek.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Among all these nations one holds a special place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
in the history of the Eastern Empire. The loss of the
Oriental and Latin provinces of the Empire brought
into practical working, though not into any formal
notice, the fact that, as the Western Empire was fast
becoming German, so the Eastern Empire was fast
becoming Greek.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of the
Oriental
provinces,<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To a state which had both a Roman
and a Greek side the loss of provinces which were
neither Roman nor Greek was not a loss but a source
of strength.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of the
Latin provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And if the loss of the Latin provinces
was not a source of strength, it at least did much to
bring the Greek element in the Empire into predominance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dying out
of Roman
ideas.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile, within the lands which were left to
the Empire, first the Latin language, and then Roman
ideas and traditions generally, gradually died out.
Before the end of the eleventh century, the Empire
was far more Greek than anything else. Before the
end of the twelfth century, it had become nearly conterminous
with the Greek nation, as defined by the
combined use of the Greek language and profession of
the Orthodox faith. The name <i>Roman</i>, in its Greek
form, was coming to mean <i>Greek</i>. And, about the
same time, the other primitive nations of the peninsula,
hitherto merged in the common mass of Roman
subjects, began to show themselves more distinctly
alongside of the Greeks.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Appearance
of Albanians
and
Vlachs.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We now first hear of <i>Albanians</i>
and <i>Vlachs</i> by those names, and the importance
of the nations which have thus come again to
light increases as we go on.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Latin
Conquest,
1204.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then the Greek remnant
of the Empire was broken in pieces by the great Latin
invasion, and, instead of a single power, Roman or
Greek, we see a crowd of separate states, Greek and
Frank.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The revived
Byzantine
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The reunion of some of these fragments
formed the revived Empire of the Palaiologoi. But at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
no moment since the twelfth century has the whole
Greek nation been united under a single power, native
or foreign.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1461-1821.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And from the Ottoman conquest of Trebizond
to the beginning of the Greek War of Independence,
the whole of the Greek nation was under foreign
masters.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>


<p class="p2">We have now first to trace out the steps by which
the Empire was broken in pieces, and then to trace out
severally the geographical history of the states which
rose out of its fragments. And with these last we may
class certain powers which do not strictly come under
that definition, but which come within the same geographical
range and which absorbed parts of the Imperial
territory. Beginning in the West, the territory which
the Empire at the final separation still held west of the
Hadriatic, was gradually lost through the attacks, first
of the Saracens, then of the Normans.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These lands
grew into the kingdom of <i>Sicily</i>, which has its proper
place here as an offshoot from the Eastern Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At
the other end of the Italian peninsula, <i>Venice</i> gradually
detached itself from the Empire, to become foremost in
its partition: here then comes the place of Venice as a
maritime power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slavonic
powers.<br />
Bulgaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then come the powers which arose
on the north and north-west of the Empire, powers
chiefly Slavonic, reckoning as Slavonic the great Bulgarian
kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hungary.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Here too will come the kingdom of
Hungary, which, as a non-Aryan power in the heart of
Europe, has much both of likeness and of contrast with
Bulgaria. The kingdom of Hungary itself lay beyond
the bounds of the Empire, but a large part of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
dependent territory had been Imperial soil.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Albanians.<br />
Roumans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Here also
we must speak of the states which arose out of the
new developement of the Albanian and Rouman
races, and of the states, Greek and Frank, which arose
just before and at the time of the Latin Conquest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Asiatic
powers.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then there are the powers, both Christian and Mahometan,
which arose within the Imperial dominions in
Asia. Here we have to speak alike of the states
founded by the Crusaders and of the growth of the
Ottoman Turks. Lastly, we come to the work of our
own days, to the new European states which have been
formed by the deliverance of old Imperial lands from
Ottoman bondage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>800-1204.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We will therefore first trace the geographical
changes in the frontier of the Empire itself down to
the Latin Conquest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1204-1453.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Latin Empire of <i>Romania</i>,
the Greek Empire of <i>Nikaia</i>, the revived Greek Empire
of Constantinople, will follow, as continuing, at least
geographically, the true Eastern Roman Empire. Then
will come the powers which have fallen off from the
Empire or grown up within the Empire, from Sicily to
free Bulgaria. But it must be remembered that it is
not always easy to mark, either chronologically or on
the map, when this or that territory was finally lost to
the Empire. This is true both on the Slavonic border
and also in southern Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distinction
between
conquest
and settlement.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the former above all
it is often hard to distinguish between conquest at the
cost of the Empire and settlement within the Empire.
In either case the frontier within which the Emperors
exercised direct authority was always falling back and
advancing again. Beyond this there was a zone which
could not be said to be under the Emperor’s direct
rule, but in which his overlordship was more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
fully acknowledged, according to the relative strength
of the Empire and of its real or nominal vassals.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>Changes in the Frontier of the Empire.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Power of
revival in
the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In tracing the fluctuations of the frontier of the
Eastern Empire from the beginning of the ninth century,
we are struck by the wonderful power of revival
and reconquest which is shown throughout the whole
history. Except the lands which were won by the
first Saracens, hardly a province was finally lost till it
had been once or twice won back. No one could
have dreamed that the Empire of the seventh century,
cut short by the Slavonic settlements to a mere fringe
on its European coasts, could ever have become the
Empire of the eleventh century, holding a solid mass of
territory from Tainaros to the Danube. But before
this great revival, the borders of the Empire had both
advanced and fallen back in the farther West.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sardinia,
Sicily,
Southern
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the
time of the separation of the Empires, the New Rome
still held Sardinia, Sicily, and a small part of southern
Italy. The heel of the boot still formed the theme of
<i>Lombardy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> while the toe took the name of <i>Calabria</i>
which had once belonged to the heel. <i>Naples</i>, <i>Gaeta</i>,
and <i>Amalfi</i> were outlying Italian cities of the Empire;
so was <i>Venice</i>, which can hardly be called an Italian
city.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of the

In the course of the ninth century the power of
the Empire was cut short in the islands, but advanced
on the mainland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Sardinia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The history of Sardinia is utterly
obscure; but it seems to have passed away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span>
Empire by the beginning of the ninth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Sicily,
827-965.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Sicily
was now conquered bit by bit by the Saracens of Africa
during a struggle of one hundred and forty years.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Agrigentum,
827;<br />
of Palermo,
831;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Agrigentum</i>,
opposite to the African coast, fell first; <i>Palermo</i>,
once the seat of Phœnician rule, became four years later
the new Semitic capital.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Messina,
842;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Messina</i> on the strait soon
followed; but the eastern side of the island, its most
thoroughly Greek side, held out much longer.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Malta, 869;<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before
the conquest of this region, <i>Malta</i>, the natural appendage
to Sicily, passed into Saracen hands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Syracuse,
878.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Syracuse</i>, the
Christian capital, did not fall till fifty years after the
first invasion, and in the north-western corner of the
island a remnant still held out for nearly ninety years.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tauromenion,
902-963.<br />
Rametta,
965.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Tauromenion</i> or <i>Taormina</i>, on its height, had to be
twice taken in the course of the tenth century, and the
single fort of <i>Rametta</i>, the last stronghold of Eastern
Christendom in the West, held out longer still. By
this time Eastern Christendom was fast advancing on
Islam in Asia; but the greatest of Mediterranean
islands passed from Christendom to Islam, from Europe
to Africa, and a Greek-speaking people was cut off
from the Empire which was fast becoming Greek.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Partial
recovery
and final
loss of
Sicily,
1038-1042.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
the complete and uninterrupted Mussulman dominion
in Sicily was short. The Imperial claims were never
forgotten, and in the eleventh century they were again
enforced. By the arms of George Maniakês, Messina
and Syracuse, with a part of the island which at the
least took in the whole of its eastern side, was, if only
for a few years, restored to the Imperial rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance of
the Empire
in Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While Sicily was thus lost bit by bit, the power of
the Empire was advancing in the neighbouring mainland
of Italy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Taking of
Bari, 871.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Bari</i> was won back for Christendom
from the Saracen by the combined powers of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
Empires; but the lasting possession of the prize fell to
the Cæsar of the East. At the end of the ninth century,
the Eastern Empire claimed either the direct possession
or the superiority of all southern Italy from
Gaeta downwards.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations
of the
Imperial
power in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The extent of the Imperial
dominion was always fluctuating; there was perhaps
no moment when the power of the Emperors was really
extended over this whole region; but there was perhaps
no spot within it which did not at some time or other
admit at least the Imperial overlordship. The eastern
coast, with the heel and the toe in a wider sense than
before, became a real and steady possession, while the
allegiance of <i>Beneventum</i>, <i>Capua</i>, and <i>Salerno</i> was always
very precarious.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Naples,
Gaeta, and
Amalfi.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But <i>Naples</i>, <i>Gaeta</i>, and <i>Amalfi</i>, however
nominal their allegiance might be, never formally
cast it aside.</p>

<p>Thus, at the beginning of the ninth century, the
Eastern Emperors held all Sicily, with some patches of
territory on the neighbouring mainland. At the beginning
of the eleventh century, the island had been wholly
lost, while the dominion on the mainland had been
greatly enlarged.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Normans
in
Italy and
Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the course of the eleventh century
a new power, the Normans of Apulia, conquered the
Italian possessions of the Empire, won Sicily from the
Mussulman, and even made conquests from the Empire
east of the Hadriatic. Thus arose the Sicilian kingdom,
the growth of which will best be traced when we
come to the powers which arose out of the breaking-up
of the Empire.</p>


<p class="p2">The great islands of the Eastern Mediterranean also
fluctuated between Byzantine and Saracen dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Crete, 823.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Crete</i> was won by a band of Mussulman adventurers from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
Spain nearly at the time when the conquest of Sicily
began.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its recovery,
963.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was won back in the great revival of the Imperial
power one hundred and forty years later.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cyprus lost,
708; recovered
and
lost again
c. 881-888;

<i>Cyprus</i>
was lost sooner; but it went through many fluctuations
and divisions, a recovery and a second loss, before
its final recovery at the same time as the recovery of
Crete and the complete loss of Sicily.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss and
gain
among the
great islands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Looking at the
Empire simply as a power, there can be no doubt that
the loss of Sicily was altogether overbalanced by the
recovery of Crete and Cyprus. Geographically Sicily
was an outlying Greek island; Crete and Cyprus lay
close to the body of the Empire, essential parts of a
Greek state. But Crete and Cyprus, as lands which had
been lost and won back, were among the lands where
the tendency to fall away from within showed itself
earliest. Crete never actually separated from the
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Separation
of Cyprus,
1182-1185.<br />
Conquered
by Richard
of Poitou,
1191.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Cyprus fell away under a rebel Emperor, to
be presently conquered by Richard, Count of Poitou
and King of England, and to pass away from the
Empire for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations
in the
possession
of the great
islands,
801.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">We may thus sum up the fluctuations in the
possession of the great islands. At the beginning of
the ninth century, the Eastern Empire still took in
Sardinia, Sicily, and Crete; Cyprus was in the hands
of the Saracens.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>901.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the beginning of the tenth
century, the Empire held nothing in any of the four
except the north-eastern corner of Sicily.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1001.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the beginning
of the eleventh, Crete and Cyprus had been won
back; Sicily was wholly lost.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1101.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the beginning of the
twelfth, Crete and Cyprus were still Imperial possessions;
a great part of Sicily had been won and lost
again.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1201.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the beginning of the thirteenth, Cyprus,
like Sicily, had passed to a Western master; Crete was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
still held by the Empire, but only by a very feeble tie.
Thus they stood at the fall of the old Roman Empire
of the East; of the revived Empire of the Palaiologoi
none of them ever formed a part.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations of
the Empire
towards the
Slavonic
powers.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">In the islands the enemies with whom the Empire
had to strive were, first the Saracens, and then the
Latins or Franks, the nations of Western Europe. On
the mainland the part of the Saracen was taken by
the Slave. During the four hundred years between
the division of the Empires and the Frank conquest
of the East, the geographical history of the Eastern
Empire has mainly to deal with the shiftings of its
frontier towards the Slavonic powers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Three
Slavonic
groups.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These fall into
three main groups.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Servia and
Croatia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
First, in the north-western corner
of the Empire, are the Croatian and Servian settlements,
whose history is closely connected with that of the
kingdom of Hungary and the commonwealth of Venice.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Macedonia
and Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Secondly, there are the Slaves of Thrace, Macedonia,
and Greece.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bulgaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thirdly, the great Bulgarian kingdom
comes between the two. These two last ranges gradually
merge into one; the first remains distinct throughout.
Servia, Croatia, and Dalmatia, will be best
treated of in another section, remembering that, amidst
all fluctuations, the claims of the Empire over them
were never denied or forgotten, and were from time to
time enforced. It was towards the Bulgarian kingdom that
the greatest fluctuations of the Imperial frontier took
place.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Bulgarian
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The original Finnish Bulgarians were the vanguard
of Turanian invasion in the lands with which we have
to do. Earlier, it would seem, in their coming than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span>
the Avars, they were slower to settle down into actual
occupation of European territory. But when they
did settle, it was not on the outskirts of the Empire,
but in one of its acknowledged provinces.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlement
south of
the Danube,
679.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Late in the
seventh century, the first Bulgarian kingdom was established
between Danube and Hæmus. It must be remembered
that another migration in quite another
direction founded another Bulgarian power on the
Volga and the Kama.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>White
Bulgaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This settlement, <i>Great</i> or <i>White
Bulgaria</i>, remained Turanian and became Mahometan;
<i>Black Bulgaria</i> on the Danube became Christian and
Slavonic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
Bulgarian
name.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The modern Bulgarians bear the Bulgarian
name only in the way in which the Romanized Celts
of Gaul bear the name of their Frankish masters from
Germany, in which the Slaves of Kief and Moscow
bear the name of their Russian masters from Scandinavia.
In all three cases, the power formed by the
union of conquerors and conquered has taken the
name of the conquerors and has kept the speech of the
conquered. But though the Bulgarian power became
essentially Slavonic, it took quite another character
from the less fully organized Slavonic settlements
to the west and south of it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Empire
and the
Macedonian
Slaves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Towards the Slaves of
Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece, it cannot be said
that the Empire had any definite frontier. Settled
within the Empire, they were its tributaries or its
enemies, according to the strength of the Empire at
any particular moment. Up to the coming of the
Bulgarians, we might, from different points of view,
place the Imperial border either at the Danube or at
no great distance from the Ægæan.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Empire
and the
Bulgarian
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But from the
Bulgarian conquest onwards, there was on the Bulgarian
side a real frontier, a frontier which often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">{375}</a></span>
shifted, but which was often fixed by treaty, and which,
wherever it was fixed, marked off lands which were, for
the time, wholly lost to the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of the
Danubian
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
With the first
Bulgarian settlement, the Imperial frontier definitely
withdrew for three hundred years from the lower Danube
to the line of Hæmus or Balkan.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bulgarians
south of
Hæmus.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the Bulgarian
power pushed to the south and west the two fields of
warfare, against the Bulgarians to the north and against
the half-independent Slaves to the west, gradually
melted into one. But as long as the Isaurian Emperors
reigned, the two fields were kept distinct.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
Bulgaria in

century.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They kept
the Balkan range against the Bulgarians, whose kingdom,
stretching to the north-west over lands which are
now Servian, had not, at the end of the eighth century,
passed the mountain barrier of the Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovery
of the
Slavonic
settlements
in Macedonia
and
Greece.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile, as a wholly distinct work, the Imperial
power was restored over the Slaves of Thrace,
Macedonia, and Greece. In the middle of the eighth,
century the inland parts of Greece were chiefly occupied
by Slavonic immigrants, while the coast and the cities
remained Greek.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>775-784.<br />
807.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before the end of the century, the
Slaves of Macedonia were reduced to tribute, and early
in the ninth, those of Greece wholly failed to recover
their independence.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovery of
Greece from
the Slaves.<br />
Slaves on
Taÿgetos.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The land was gradually settled
afresh by Greek colonists, and by the middle of the
tenth, only two Slavonic tribes, <i>Melings</i> and <i>Ezerites</i>
(<i>Melinci</i> and <i>Jezerci</i>), remained, distinct, though tributary,
on the range of Taÿgetos or Pentedaktylos.
From this time to the Frankish conquest, Greece, as a
whole, was held by the Empire. But, as a recovered
land, it was one of those parts of the Empire in which
a tendency to separate began to show itself. In the
course of these changes, the name <i>Hellênes</i>, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
national name, quite died out.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hellênes of
Maina.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It had long meant
<i>pagan</i>, and it was confined to the people of <i>Maina</i>, who
remained pagan till near the end of the ninth century.
The Greeks now knew no name but that of <i>Romans</i>.
The local, perhaps contemptuous, name of the inhabitants
of Hellas was <i>Helladikoi</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, at the division of the Empires, Thrace, Macedonia,
and Greece had been more or less thoroughly recovered
by the Eastern Empire, while the lands between
Hæmus and Danube were wholly lost.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Romania.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dalmatia,

The Emperors also kept
the cities on the Dalmatian coast, and the precarious

These lands were bound to the Empire by a common
dread of the encroaching Bulgarian.

Empire they were more successful.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance
against the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of the
eighth century <i>Anchialos</i> and <i>Sardica</i>—afterwards
called <i>Triaditza</i> and <i>Sofia</i>—were border cities of the
Empire. The conquest of Sardica early in the ninth
marks a stage of Bulgarian advance. At the end of
the century, after the conversion of the nation to
Christianity, comes the great era of the first Bulgarian
kingdom, the kingdom of <i>Peristhlava</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests

923-934.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Tzar Simeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
established the Bulgarian supremacy over Servia, and
carried his conquests deep into the lands of the Empire.
In Macedonia and Epeiros the Empire kept only the
sea-coast, Ægæan and Hadriatic; Sardica, Philippopolis,
Ochrida, were all cities of the Bulgarian realm.
Hadrianople, a frontier city of the Empire, passed more
than once into Bulgarian hands. Nowhere in Europe,
save in old Hellas, did the Imperial dominion stretch
from sea to sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Revival of

power.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>So stood matters in the middle of the tenth century.
Then came that greatest of all revivals of the

which was no less successful on the mainland of Europe
and Asia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of

Bulgaria was conquered and lost and conquered

The
Russians, long dangerous to Constantinople, now suddenly
appear as a land power. Their prince Sviatoslaf
overthrew the first Bulgarian kingdom, and
Philippopolis became for a moment a Russian outpost.
But John Tzimiskês restored the power of the Empire
over the whole Bulgarian dominions. The Danube was
once more the frontier of the Eastern Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The second
Bulgarian
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It remained so for more than two hundred years
during the lower part of its course. But in the inland
regions the Imperial power fell back almost at once, to
advance again further than ever. A large part of the
conquered land soon revolted, and a second Bulgarian
kingdom, Macedonian rather than Mœsian, arose. The
kingdom of <i>Ochrida</i>, the kingdom of Samuel, left to
the Empire the eastern part of the old Bulgaria between
Danube and Hæmus, together with all Thrace
and the Macedonian coast. But it took in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
inland region of Macedonia; it stretched down into
Thessaly and Epeiros; and, while it nowhere touched
the Euxine or the Ægæan, it had a small seaboard on
the Hadriatic. Now came the great struggle between
Romania and Bulgaria which fills the last years of the
tenth century and the opening years of the eleventh.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second conquest

At last all Bulgaria, and with it for a while Servia,
was restored to the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Croatia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Croatia continued its
vassalage, and its princes were presently raised to royal
rank by Imperial authority.</p>

<p>Thus the Eastern Empire again took in the whole
south-eastern peninsula. Of its outlying European
possessions, southern Italy was still untouched.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At
what moment Venice ceased to be a dependency of the
Empire, it would be hard to say. Its dukes still received
the Imperial investiture, and Venetian ships often joined
the Imperial fleet. This state of things seems never
to have been formally abolished, but rather to have
dropped out of sight as Venice and Constantinople became
practically hostile. In the other outlying city
north of the Euxine the ninth and tenth centuries
change places. Through all changes the Empire kept
its maritime province in the Tauric Chersonêsos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cherson

<p class="pb2">In Asia the Imperial frontier had changed but
little since the first Saracen conquests. The solid
peninsula of Asia Minor was often plundered by the
Mussulmans, but it was never conquered. Now, in Asia
as in Europe, came a time of advance. For eighty years,
with some fluctuations, the Empire grew on its eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>

the smaller emirates were more easily overcome.

Basil the Second extended the Imperial power
over the <i>Iberian</i> and <i>Abasgian</i> lands east of the Euxine,
and began a series of transactions by which, in the

Empire on the very eve of the downfall of the Imperial
power in Asia.</p>

In Asia it became

Plunder grew into conquest,

The Emperors now tried to strengthen this dangerous

The Norman conquerors

occupied various points, both insular and continental,
especially <i>Dyrrhachion</i> or <i>Durazzo</i> and the island
of <i>Korkyra</i>, now called by a new Greek name, <i>Koryphô</i>
or <i>Corfu</i>. At every point of its frontier the
Empire had, towards the end of the eleventh century,
altogether fallen back from the splendid position
which it held at its beginning.

The geographical
aspect of the Empire was now the exact opposite of
what it had been in the eighth and ninth centuries.
Then its main strength seemed to lie in Asia. Its
European dominion had been cut down to the coasts
and islands; but its Asiatic peninsula was firmly held,
touched only by passing ravages. Now the Asiatic
dominion was cut down to the coasts and islands, while
the great European peninsula was, in the greater part
of its extent, still firmly held. Never before had
the main power of the Empire been so thoroughly
European. No wonder that in Western eyes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>

The crusades concern us here only
as helping towards the next revival of the Imperial
power under the house of Komnênos. Alexios himself
won back Nikaia and the other great cities of western
Asia Minor. Some of these, as <i>Laodikeia</i>, were received
rather as free cities of the Empire than as mere
subjects.

Hungary itself had to yield <i>Zeugmin</i>, <i>Sirmium</i>,

For a moment the Empire again
took in the whole eastern coast of the Hadriatic and
its islands; even on its western shore <i>Ancona</i> became
something like a dependency of the Eastern Cæsar.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Falling of

<p>The conquests of Manuel were clearly too great for

at once.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dalmatia,

Dalmatia was left to be struggled for between
Venice and Hungary. And the tendency to fall away
within the Empire became strengthened by increased
intercourse with the feudal ideas of the West. Cyprus,
Trebizond, old Greece itself, came into the hands of
rulers who were rather feudal vassals than Roman governors.
We have seen how Cyprus fell away. Its Poitevin
conqueror presently gave it to Guy of Lusignan.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Latin kingdom

Thus,
before the Latin conquest of Constantinople, a province

Latin kingdom. The Greek-speaking lands were now
beginning largely to pass under Latin rule. In Sicily
the Frank might pass for a deliverer; in Corfu and
Cyprus he was a mere foreign invader.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The third

<p class="pb2">Meanwhile the Empire was again cut short to the
north by a new Bulgarian revolt, which established
a third Bulgarian kingdom, but a kingdom which
seems to have been as much Vlach or Rouman as
strictly Bulgarian. The new kingdom took in the old
Bulgarian land between Danube and Hæmus, and it
presently spread both to the west and to the south.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Other

The Bulgarian revolt was followed by other movements
among the Thracian and Macedonian Slaves, which did
not lead to the foundation of any new states, but which
had their share in the general break-up of the Imperial
power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Increased
Greek
character of
the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The work of Basil and Manuel was now undone,
but its undoing had the effect of making the
Empire more nearly a Greek state than ever. It did
not wholly coincide with the Greek-speaking lands:
the Empire had subjects who were not Greeks, and
there were Greeks who were not subjects of the Empire.
But the Greek speech and the new Greek
nationality were dominant within the lands which were
still left to the Empire. The Roman name was now
merely a name: Roman and Greek meant the same
thing. Whatever was not Greek in European Romania
was mainly Albanian and Vlach. The dominion of
the Empire in the peninsula was mainly confined to
the primitive races of the peninsula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Slavonic
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The great element
of later times, the Slavonic settlers, had almost
wholly separated themselves from the Empire, establishing
their independence, but not their unity. They
formed a group of independent powers which had simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">{383}</a></span>
fallen away from the Empire; it was by the powers of
the West that the Empire itself was to be broken in
pieces.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Latin conquest
of
Constantinople,
1204.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The taking of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade
was the work of an alliance between the now independent
commonwealth of Venice and a body of Western
crusaders who, along with the states which they
founded, may be indifferently called <i>Latins</i> or <i>Franks</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Act of
Partition.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
A regular act of partition was drawn out, by which the
Empire was to be divided into three parts. One was
to be assigned to a Latin <i>Emperor of Romania</i>, another
of the pilgrims as his feudatories, a third to the commonwealth
of Venice. But the partition was never
carried out. A large part of the Empire was never
conquered; another large part was not assigned by the
act of partition. In fact the scheme of partition is
hardly a geographical fact at all. The real partition
to which the Latin conquest led was one of quite
another kind, a partition of the Empire among a
crowd of powers, Greek, Frank, and Venetian, more
than one of which had some claim to represent the
Empire itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Latin Empire
of
Romania.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These were the Latin Empire of <i>Romania</i>, and the
Greek Empire which maintained itself at <i>Nikaia</i>, and
which, after nearly sixty years of banishment, won
back the Imperial city. In the crusading scheme the
Latin Emperor was to be the feudal superior of the
lesser princes who were to establish themselves within
the Empire. For his own Imperial domain he was to
have the whole of the Imperial possessions in Asia, with
a Thracian dominion stretching as far north as <i>Agathopolis</i>.
Hadrianople, with a narrow strip of territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
stretching down to the Propontis, was to be Venetian.
The actual result was very different.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its extent.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Latin Emperors
never got any footing in Asia beyond parts of
the themes bordering on the Propontis, reaching from
Adramyttion to the mouth of the Sangarios. In Europe
they held the eastern part of Thrace, with a fluctuating
border towards Bulgaria on the north, and to the new
Latin and Greek states which arose to the west. Their
dominion also took in <i>Lêmnos</i>, <i>Lesbos</i>, <i>Chios</i>, and some
others of the Ægæan islands.</p>

<p>But the Latin Empire of Romania was not the only
Empire which arose out of the break-up of the old
East-Roman power. Two, for a time three, Greek
princes bore the Imperial title; there was also a Latin
king. It will be convenient for a while to leave out of
sight both Asia and southern Greece, and to look to
the revolutions of Thrace, Macedonia, northern Greece,
and what we may now begin to call <i>Albania</i>. The immediate
result of the Latin conquest was to divide
these lands between three powers, two Latin and one
Greek.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Thessalonikê.
1204-1222.
Despotat of

Besides the Empire of Romania, there was the
Latin kingdom of <i>Thessalonikê</i>, and the Greek <i>despotat</i><a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
of <i>Epeiros</i> held by the house of Angelos. Of these
the Thessalonian kingdom was the most short-lived,
and there can be little doubt that its creation was the
ruin of the Latin Empire. It cut off the Emperor from
his distant vassals in Greece, whose vassalage soon
became nominal. It gave him, in successive reigns, a
powerful neighbour who knew his own power, and a
weak neighbour, who fell before the Greek advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
sooner than himself. But the beginnings of the kingdom,
under its first king Boniface, were promising. His
power stretched over Thessaly, now known as <i>Great
Vlachia</i>, and he received the homage of the Frank
princes further to the south. But within twenty years
from its foundation, Frank rule had ceased in Macedonia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thessalonikê

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Epeirot
despotat.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This blow came from the west. It was the Nicene
Empire which did in the end win back the Imperial
city; but, for some years after the Latin conquest, things
looked as if the restoration of the Greek power in Europe
was designed for Epeiros. The first despot Michael
paid a nominal homage to all the neighbouring powers,
Greek and Frank, in turn; but in truth he was the lord
of an independent and growing state. His power began
in the Epeirot land west of Pindos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1208-1210.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Thessalonikê was taken; its ruler took the Imperial title;
Hadrianople followed, and the new Empire stretched
across the peninsula from sea to sea, and took in Thessaly

hardly more long-lived than the Thessalonian kingdom.
It was first dismembered among the princes of the
ruling house.

The original Epeirot despotat, along
with Corfu, parted away from the new Macedonian
power, to survive it by many years. But by this
time the championship of the Greek speech and faith
against the Latin lords of Constantinople had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
to the foremost of the Greek powers which had grown
up in Asia, to the Empire of Nikaia.</p>

<p>These Greek powers were two, which arose at the
same time, but by different processes and with different
destinies.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Empire
of Trebizond,
1204-1461.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Empire of <i>Nikaia</i> was the truer continuation
of the old East-Roman power; the Empire
of <i>Trapezous</i> or <i>Trebizond</i> was the last independent
fragment of Roman dominion and Greek culture. The
Trapezuntine Empire was not in strictness one of the
states which arose out of the Latin partition. One of
the parts of the Empire which showed most disposition
to fall away was independently seized by a rival
Emperor, at the very moment of the Latin conquest.
Alexios Komnênos occupied Trebizond, an occupation
largely wrought by Iberian help, as if the Empire,
already dismembered by the Christians of the West,
was to be further dismembered by the Christians
of the further East.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent

dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dominions of Alexios, enlarged
by his brother David to the west, at first took
in the whole south coast of the Euxine from the Sangarios
eastward, broken by the city of <i>Amisos</i>, which
contrived to make itself virtually independent, and by
the neighbouring Turkish settlement at <i>Samsoun</i>. But
this dominion was only momentary. The eastern part
alone survived to form the later Empire of Trebizond;
the western part, the government of David, soon passed
to the rising power of Nikaia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Empire of

<p>That Empire still lasted a hundred and ninety years,

In Europe the revived Empire kept the character of an

For a while the Imperial frontier was stationary, but
from the beginning of the fourteenth century it steadily
advanced. It advanced perhaps all the more after
Peloponnêsos became an Imperial dependency, or an
appanage for princes of the Imperial house, rather than
an immediate possession of the Empire.

The frontier varied towards
Servia, Bulgaria, Epeiros, and the Angevin power

Later still, all Epeiros, <i>Jôannina</i> and <i>Arta</i>—once

great Servian advance, the Empire held the uninterrupted
seaboard from the Euxine to the Pagasaian
Gulf, as well as its Hadriatic seaboard from the Ambrakian
gulf northward. But the Frank principalities

The Imperial
power steadily crumbled away before the advance of
the Turk, first the Seljuk and then the Ottoman. The
small Turkish powers into which the Sultanate of
Roum had now split up began to encroach on the Greek
dominion in Asia as soon as its centre was transferred
to Europe. By the end of the thirteenth century, the
Imperial possessions in Asia had again shrunk up to a

<i>Brusa</i>, <i>Nikaia</i>, <i>Nikomêdeia</i>, were all lost within twelve
years. By the middle of the fourteenth century, the
Emperors kept nothing in Asia, save a strip of land
just opposite Constantinople, and the outlying cities of
<i>Philadelphia</i> and <i>Phôkaia</i>, their allies rather than their
subjects.</p>

<p>The Ottoman was now all but ready to pass into
Europe, and the way was made easier for him by the
rise and fall of an European power which again cut
short the Empire in its western provinces.

And
now came the great momentary advance of <i>Servia</i>

a large part of its Thracian, Macedonian, Albanian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">{390}</a></span>
Greek possessions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the middle of the fourteenth
century, the Empire, all but banished from Asia, kept no
unbroken European dominion out of Thrace. Its other
possessions were isolated. It kept Thessalonikê and
Chalkidikê, with a small strip of Macedonia as far as
<i>Berrhoia</i> and <i>Vodena</i>. It kept a small Thessalian territory
about <i>Lamia</i> or <i>Zeitouni</i>. There was the Peloponnesian
province, fast growing into importance;
there was <i>Lesbos</i> and a few other islands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1355.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On
Stephen’s death his dominion broke in pieces, but the
Empire did not win back its lost lands. For the
Ottoman was already in Europe, ready, in the space of
the next hundred years, to swallow up all that was left.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>1336.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">As in the recovery of Romania by the Greeks of
Nikaia, so in the final conquest of Romania by the
Turks of Brusa, Constantinople itself was—with the
exception of the Peloponnesian appanage—the last
point of the Empire to fall. The Turk, like the Greek,
made his way in by Kallipolis; like the Greek, he
hemmed in the Imperial city for years before it fell
into his hands.

In seven years from his first landing,
Hadrianople had become the European capital of the
Turk; the Empire was his tributary, keeping, besides
its outlying possessions, only the land just round the
city. The romantic expedition of Amadeo of Savoy
gave back to the Empire its Euxine coast as far as
<i>Mesêmbria</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of

Peloponnesian province. Thessalonikê and the Thessalian

At last the boundaries of the
Empire were fixed by treaty between Sultan Mahomet
and the Emperor Manuel, much as they had stood sixty
years before. The coast of the Propontis to Selymbria,
the coast of the Euxine to Mesêmbria, Thessalonikê and
Chalkidikê, the Peloponnesian province, the smaller
Thessalian province, the overlordship of Lesbos, Ainos,
and Thasos, was all that was left. Further losses soon
followed.

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>States
growing
out of the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Having thus sketched the changes in the extent of
the Eastern Roman Empire during a period of six hundred
and fifty years, we have now to trace the geography
of the states which, within that time, grew up
within its borders or upon its frontiers. These fall
naturally into four groups.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Slavonic
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
First come the national
states which were formed by throwing off the dominion
of the Empire. These are mainly the Slavonic powers
to the north, Bulgaria, Servia, Croatia, and the later
states which arose out of their divisions and combinations.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hungary.<br />
Rouman
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And with these, different as was their origin, we
must, for our purposes, place both the <i>Hungarian</i> kingdom
which annexed so many of the Slavonic lands, and
the <i>Rouman</i> states, so closely connected with Hungarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
history, which arose by migrations out of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Greek
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another group consists of the Greek states which split
off from the Empire before or at the Latin conquest,
and which were not recovered by the Greek Emperors
of Nikaia and Constantinople. Both these classes of
states belong strictly to Eastern Christendom. Catholic
Hungary ruling over Orthodox Slaves forms a link
between the East and the West; so do those Slaves who
themselves belong to the Latin Church.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Latin states
with the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another link is
supplied by a third group of states, namely, those parts
of the Empire which, either at or before the Latin conquest,
came under Latin rule. This class is not confined
to the Frank powers in Romania or to the Eastern settlements
of Venice and Genoa.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Sicily.<br />
Kingdom of
Jerusalem.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From our point of view
it takes in the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the crusading
kingdom of Jerusalem with its fiefs. In all
these cases, territory which had formed part of the
Eastern Empire came under Latin rule. And in all
these cases, Latin masters bore rule over alien subjects,
Greek, Slave, Syrian, or any other. None of the Latin
powers were national states, like the Slavonic or even
like the Greek powers. But the foreign masters of these
lands were at least European and Christian. The last
class consists of powers which lie beyond the range of
European and Christian civilization.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Turkish
dynasties.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These are the
Turkish dynasties which arose within the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Ottomans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of
these only the last and greatest, the dynasty of <i>Othman</i>,
became geographically European, and swallowed
up nearly all the lands which had belonged to the
Empire in Europe, together with much which lay
beyond its bounds. Here we have, not only the
absence of national being, but the rule of the Asiatic
over the European, of the Mussulman over the Christian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">{393}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The New
States.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, we come to the partial redressing of this
wrong by the re-establishment of independent Greek
and Slavonic states in our own century.</p>

<p>These seem to make four natural groups, and it is
needful to bear in mind their nature and relations to
each other. But it will be more convenient to speak of
the several states thus formed in an order approaching
more nearly to the order of their separation from the
Empire. And first comes a power which parted off
so early, and which became so thoroughly a part of
Western Europe, that it needs an effort to grasp the
fact that its right place is among the powers which had
their beginning in separation from the Imperial throne
of Constantinople.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>The Kingdom of Sicily.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Norman
power in
Italy and
Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This is the power which, in the course of the eleventh
century, was formed by the Norman adventurers in
southern Italy and in Sicily. It was not wholly
formed at the expense of the Eastern Empire. But
all its insular, and the greater part of its continental,
territory, was either won from the Eastern Empire and
its vassals, or else had once formed part of that Empire.
Its kings also more than once established their power,
for a longer or shorter time, in the Imperial lands
east of the Hadriatic. With the Western Empire and
the Kingdom of Italy the Sicilian kingdom had in its
beginnings nothing to do, though it was afterwards
somewhat enlarged at their expense.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Possessions
of the
Empire in
Italy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When the Norman conquests in Italy began, early
in the eleventh century, the Eastern Empire still kept
the coast of both seas from the further side of the peninsula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
of <i>Gargano</i> to the head of the gulf of <i>Policastro</i>.
The Imperial duchies of Naples, Gaeta, and Amalfi,
lying to the north of this point, were cut off by the
duchies of <i>Benevento</i>, <i>Capua</i>, and <i>Salerno</i>, over which
the Empire had at the most a very precarious superiority.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance of
the Normans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Within a hundred years, all these lands, together
with the island of Sicily, were brought under
Norman rule. Thus grew up a new European power,
sometimes forming one kingdom, sometimes two, sometimes
held alone, sometimes together with other kingdoms.
This power supplanted alike the Eastern Empire,
the Saracen powers of Sicily, and the Lombard
princes of southern Italy. It started from two points,
two distinct Norman settlements, of which the later outshone
the earlier.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Aversa,
1021.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The earliest Norman territorial settlement
was the county of <i>Aversa</i>, held in vassalage of the
Imperial duchy of Naples.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Principality
of Capua,
1062-1068.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Forty years later its counts
became possessed of the principality of <i>Capua</i>, of which
they received a papal confirmation which implied a
denial of all dependence on either Empire. The more
lasting duchy of <i>Apulia</i> began later under the adventurers
of the house of Hauteville.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Apulia,
1042.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Their first stage is
marked by the foundation of the county of Apulia, with
<i>Melfi</i> as its capital, under William of-the-Iron-arm.
This took in the peninsula of Gargano and the lands
immediately to the south of it.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Investiture
by Pope
Leo, 1053.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The next stage is when
Leo the Ninth invested Count Humfrey, or rather the
Normans as a body, with all that they could conquer
in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Robert
Wiscard
Duke, 1059.<br />
Completion
of the
Apulian
duchy,
1077.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first of several
takings of <i>Tarentum</i>, and the assumption of the ducal
title by Robert Wiscard, mark another stage. Less
than twenty years later the Eastern Empire kept
nothing but the duchy of Naples; <i>Benevento</i> had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
to the Popes. The rest of the lands both of the Empire
and of the Lombard princes were now very unequally
divided between two Norman lords, the Duke of Apulia
and the Prince of Capua.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Robert
Wiscard in
Epeiros,
1081-1085.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Byzantine power west of
the Hadriatic being thus overthrown, Robert Wiscard
for the first time pushed the Norman arms into the
Eastern peninsula itself. For the last few years of his
life he held the islands of Corfu and Kephallênia, with
Durazzo and the coast to the south, and even inland as
far as <i>Kastoria</i> and <i>Trikkala</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1147-1150.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
His power was renewed
for a moment by his son Bohemond, and in the middle
of the next century Corfu was again for a short time
held by King Roger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Norman
Conquest of
Sicily,
1060-1093.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>For by that time the island of Sicily was a kingdom
of Western Christendom. The second time of Mussulman
rule over the whole island was short. In the
space of thirty years Count Roger won the great island
alike from Islam and from Eastern Christendom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Taking of

Greek Messina was first won; after a while Saracen Palermo followed;
Syracuse was won much later; the last Saracen post in the island to
hold out was <i>Noto</i> in the south-eastern corner.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>of Malta,
1091.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Malta</i>, the natural appendage of
Sicily, was soon added. The first Norman capital was
<i>Messina</i>. Duke Robert, as overlord of his brother
Count Roger, kept Palermo and the surrounding district
in his own hands. It was not till the next century
that the Count of Sicily won full possession of the
city.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Palermo
capital of
Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Palermo then became again, as it had been
under the Saracens, the head of Sicily.</p>

<p>The ruler of Sicily also became a potentate on the
Italian mainland. First the half, then the whole, of
Calabria formed part of his dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Roger the
Second,
1105-1154.<br />
King, 1130.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The third
Great Count, the first King, of Sicily, Roger the Second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
gradually won the whole possessions of his family on
the mainland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Capua,
1132-1136.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To these he presently added the Norman
principality of Capua, first as a dependent territory,
then as fully incorporated with his dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Naples,
1138.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
He
next won the last possession in the West which was still
held by the Eastern Empire, the city of Naples.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Abruzzi,
1140.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
He
then pressed beyond the bounds both of the Eastern
Empire and of the early Norman conquests by the annexation
of the <i>Abruzzi</i>. He then, as we have seen,
extended his power for a moment east of the Hadriatic.
Meanwhile he was more successful against the common
enemies of Eastern and Western Christendom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
in Africa,
1135-1137.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As
Sicily had twice been conquered from Africa, Africa
now began to be conquered from Sicily.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1160.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Roger held
a considerable dominion on the African coast including
<i>Mehadia</i>, <i>Bona</i>, and other points, which were lost
under his son William.</p>

<p>Thus was founded a kingdom which has, perhaps
oftener than any other European state, been divided
and united and handed over from one dynasty of
strangers to another, but whose boundaries, strictly so
called, have hardly changed at all. For the only immediate
neighbour of the Sicilian king was his ecclesiastical
overlord. The question was whether the king of
the mainland should be also king of the island. But
the successive dynasties which reigned both over the
whole kingdom and over its divided parts were for a
long time eager to carry out the policy of their first
founder, by conquests east of the Hadriatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Epeirot

Before
the fall of the old Empire, William the Good began
again to establish an Epeirot and insular dominion by
the conquest of Durazzo, Corfu, Kephallênia, and
Zakynthos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom

in fief to the Sicilian Admiral Margarito,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> who, himself
bearing the strange title of <i>King of the Epeirots</i>,
founded a dynasty which, with the title of Count
Palatine, held <i>Kephallênia</i>, <i>Zakynthos</i>, and <i>Ithakê</i> into
the fourteenth century. Thus these lands, like Cyprus
and Trebizond, were cut off from the Empire
just before its fall, and the revolutions of Sicily cut
them off equally from the Sicilian kingdom.

Durazzo was lost and won more than once;
but it came back to the Angevin house, to become a

<p>This Eastern dominion of the two Sicilian crowns,
besides their influence of which we shall have presently
to speak in southern Greece, tends to keep up the connexion
of the Sicilian kingdoms with the Empire out
of which they sprang. But it can hardly be called a

The Sicilian

lost territory till Charles the Fifth granted Malta to the
Knights of Saint John, till Philip the Second added
the <i>Stati degli Presidi</i> to the Two Sicilies. The great
revolution of all has taken place in our own day. The
name of Sicily has for the first time been wiped from
the European map. The island of Hierôn and Roger
has sunk to form seven provinces of a prince who has
not deigned to take the crown or the title of that
illustrious realm.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>The Crusading States.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
between
Sicily and
the crusading
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Sicilian kingdom has much in common with
the states formed by the crusaders in Asia and Eastern
Europe. Both grew out of lands won by Western
conquerors, partly from the Eastern Empire itself, partly
from Mussulman holders of lands which had belonged
to the Eastern Empire. But the order of the two processes
is different. The Sicilian Normans began by
conquering lands of the Empire, and then went on to
win the island which the Saracens had torn from the
Empire. The successive crusades first founded Christian
states in the lands which the Mussulmans had won
from the Empire, and then partitioned the Empire itself.
The first crusaders undertook to hold their conquest as
fiefs of the Eastern Empire. This condition was only
very partially carried out; but the mere theory marks
a stage in the relations between the Eastern Empire
and the Latin powers of Palestine which has nothing
answering to it in the case of Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of

Jerusalem</i> and the other Frank principalities which
arose out of the first crusade.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cyprus.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The kingdom of <i>Cyprus</i>,
which in some sort continued the Kingdom of Jerusalem,
forms a link between the true crusading states
and those which arose out of the partition of the Empire
in the fourth crusade.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Armenia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And closely connected
with this was the kingdom of <i>Kilikian Armenia</i> whose
foundation we have already mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This last
was an Eastern state which became to some extent
Latinized. But the Syrian states, Cyprus, and the
Latin powers which arose out of the partition of the
Empire, all agree in being colonies of Western Europe
in Eastern lands, states where the Latin settlers appear
as a dominant race over the natives, of whatever blood
or creed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Crusaders

off the Mussulmans

sea.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The great geographical result of the first crusade
was to cut off the Mussulman powers from the seas
of Asia and Eastern Europe. In the first years of
the twelfth century the Christian powers, Byzantine,
Armenian, and Latin, held the whole coast of Asia
Minor and Syria.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the Kingdom
of
Jerusalem.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Kingdom of Jerusalem, at its
greatest extent, stretched along the coast from <i>Berytos</i>
to <i>Gaza</i>. To the east it reached some way beyond
Jordan and the Dead Sea, with a strip of territory
reaching southward to the eastern gulf of the Red Sea.
To the north lay two Latin states which, in the days of
Komnenian revival, acknowledged the superiority of the
Eastern Emperor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tripolis.<br />

These were the county of <i>Tripolis</i>,

conquest, won back to the Empire in the Macedonian
revival, lost to the Turk, won back by the Frank,
remained a Christian principality long after the fall of

citizens. Among these the first place belongs to the

itself and for particular Genoese citizens.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the part played by Genoa in the East is small
beside the great and abiding dominion of Venice.
No result of the partition was greater than the field
which it gave to Venetian growth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
between
the two.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The position of
the two commonwealths is different. Genoa was a
mere stranger in the East; Venice was in a manner at
home. Once an outlying possession of the Empire,
her really great historical position is due to her share
in its overthrow.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>The Eastern Dominion of Venice and Genoa.</i></h3>

<p>We have already seen the origin of the Venetian
state, and the beginning of Venetian rule over the Slavonic
coasts of the Hadriatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Connexion
of the
Dalmatian
and Greek
dominion of
Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Eastern dominion
of Venice now began, and, in a strictly geographical
view, her Istrian and Dalmatian dominion cannot be
separated from her Albanian and purely Greek dominion.
But Venice did not become a great European
power till she passed from the Slavonic lands whose
connexion with the Empire was nominal or precarious
into the Albanian and Greek lands which were among
its immediate possessions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effect of
the partition
on
Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The greatness of Venice
dates from that partition of the Empire which was the
surest proof that she had wholly cast aside her Byzantine
allegiance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
between
Venice and
Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In this point of view the history of Venice
may be compared and contrasted with the history of
Sicily. In each case, a part of the dominions of the
Eastern Rome grew into a separate power; that power
passed, so to speak, from Eastern Europe to Western,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">{403}</a></span>
and, in its new Western character, it appeared as a conqueror
in the Eastern lands. But, as Venice and Sicily
parted from the Empire in different ways, so their later
relations to the Empire were widely different. The
Sicilian state began in actual conquests made by foreign
invaders at the expense of the Empire. Venice was a
dependency of the Empire which gradually drifted into
independence. Thus Sicily became more thoroughly
Western than Venice. The attempts of the kings, both
of the whole Sicilian kingdom and of its divided parts,
to establish an Eastern dominion were attacks from
without, and were not really lasting.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venice
inherits
the position
of the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But Venice, whose
princes were lords of one fourth and one eighth of the
Empire of Romania,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> took up in some sort the position of
the Empire itself. If she destroyed one bulwark against
the Mussulman, she set up another. As long as Venice
was really a great power, her main interests lay east of
the Hadriatic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Importance
of the
fourth crusade
in
Venetian
history.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The fourth crusade was her turning
point. It was at once the beginning of her Greek
dominion and the recovery of her Dalmatian dominion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Territory
assigned to
Venice by
the Act of
Partition.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The scheme of partition gave to Venice a vast
dominion, insular and continental. She was to be mistress
of the Hadriatic and Ionian seas. To her were
assigned, not only the islands off the west coast of the
Empire, but the whole western coast itself, from the
north of Albania to the southern point of Peloponnêsos.
She was to have some points in the Ægæan, among
them <i>Oreos</i> and <i>Karystos</i> at the two ends of Euboia.
She was to have her quarter of the capital, with a
Thracian and an Asiatic dominion, including, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
to some versions, the strange allotment of <i>Lazia</i> at the
east of the Euxine<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her actual
possessions.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The actual possessions of Venice
in the East have a very different look. Much of the
territory which was assigned to the republic never
became hers, while she obtained large possessions
which were not assigned to her.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her dominion
primarily
Hadriatic.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the main point,
the dominion of the Hadriatic, was never forgotten,
though some both of her earliest and of her latest
conquests lay beyond its necessary range.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Possessions
not assigned
by
the partition.<br />
Crete.
1206-1669.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Among those possessions of Venice which were not
assigned to her in the act of partition was her greatest
and most lasting possession of all, the island of <i>Crete</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1645-1669.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This she won almost at the first moment of the conquest,
and she kept it for more than four centuries and a half,
till the war of <i>Candia</i> handed over all Crete, save two
fortresses, to the Ottoman.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisition
of
Cyprus.
1489.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before this loss, Saint Mark
had won and lost another great island which lay altogether
beyond the scheme of the Latin conquerors of
Constantinople. Late in the fifteenth century the
republic succeeded the Latin kings in the possession of
<i>Cyprus</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Cyprus,
1571.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But this was held for less than a century.
Cyprus, like Crete and Sicily, was a special scene of
struggle between European and barbarian powers. But
it shared the fate, not of Sicily but of Crete, and became
the solid prize of the Ottoman, when Christendom won
the barren laurels of Lepanto.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Occupation
of Thessalonikê,
1426-1430.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another possession
which lay out of the usual course of Venetian dominion
was the short occupation of <i>Thessalonikê</i>. Bought of
a Greek despot, it was after four years taken by the
Turk. Had Thessalonikê been kept, it might have
passed as a late compensation to the republic for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">{405}</a></span>
early loss of Hadrianople and her other Thracian
territory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venetian
power
both Dalmatian
and
Greek.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But the true scene of Venetian enterprise in the
East is primarily the Hadriatic, and next to that, the
coasts and islands of the Ægæan. She remained both a
Dalmatian and a Greek power down to the moment of
her overthrow, and, at the moment of her overthrow,
it was not eighty years since she had ceased to be a
Peloponnesian and an Ægæan power. The Greek
dominion of Venice was an enlargement of her Dalmatian
dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Taking of
Zara,
1202.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is significant that Zara was taken—not
for the first or the last time—on the way to
the taking of Constantinople.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hadriatic
dominion
of Venice.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Already mistress, or
striving to be mistress, of the northern part of the
eastern coast of the Hadriatic, the partition of the
Empire opened to Venice the hope of becoming mistress
of the southern part. Mistress of the whole coast she
never was at any one moment; one point was gained
and another lost. But extension in those lands was
steadily aimed at for more than seven hundred
years, and the greater part of the eastern Hadriatic
coast has been, at one time or another, under Venetian
rule.</p>

<p>The story of Venetian dominion in these parts cannot
be kept apart from the story of the neighbouring
Slavonic lands. The states of Servia and Croatia were
from the beginning the inland neighbours of the Dalmatian
coast cities.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Servian districts

coast.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The river Tzettina may pass as the

and Ragusa, <i>Terbounia</i>, represented by the modern

taking in the modern Montenegro with the coast as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">{406}</a></span>
as the Drin—<i>Skodra</i> or <i>Scutari</i> on its lake, the harbours

Servian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Dalmatian
cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Dalmatian coast cities, <i>Dekatera</i> or <i>Cattaro</i>,
<i>Raousion</i> or <i>Ragusa</i>, <i>Tragourion</i> or <i>Traü</i>, <i>Diadora</i>,
<i>Jadera</i>, or <i>Zara</i>, formed a Roman fringe on what
had become a Slavonic body. It was not even a continuous
fringe, as the Slaves came down to the sea at
more than one point.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pagania.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

It even took in most of the great islands,
<i>Curzola</i>—once <i>Black Korkyra</i>—<i>Meleda</i>, <i>Lesina</i>—once

Empires the Croatian power was strongest in those
lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Croatia

Charles the
Great, 806-810.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

More than a century
later came the first Venetian conquest, which was

Croatian rule. The pagan power on the Narenta was
destroyed, and the Duke of Venice took the title of <i>Duke
of Dalmatia</i>. But all this involved no formal separation
from the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>

when the cities again passed under Croatian rule, and
when the taking of the title of <i>King of Dalmatia</i> by
Croatian Kresimir may pass for an assertion of complete
independence.

But the kingdoms, first of Croatia,

growing power of the Magyar. Then comes a time in
which this city and that passes to and fro between
Venice and Hungary.

Under Manuel Komnênos the
whole of Croatia and Dalmatia was fully restored to the
Empire; but ten years later the cities again passed to
Hungary. This was their final separation from the
Empire, and by this time Venice had thrown off all
Byzantine allegiance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Struggle
for the
dominion of
Dalmatia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>From this time the history of Croatia forms part of
the history of the Hungarian kingdom. The history
of Dalmatia becomes part of the long struggle of
Venice for Hadriatic dominion. For five hundred
years the cities and islands of the whole Hadriatic
coast were lost and won over and over again in the
strifes of the powers of the mainland. These were in
Dalmatia the Hungarian and Bosnian Kings; more to
the south they were the endless powers which rose and
fell in Albania and northern Greece. In after times the
Ottoman took the place of all. And many of the cities
were able, amid the disputes of their stronger neighbours,
to make themselves independent commonwealths
for a longer or shorter time.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Independence

<p>The crusading conquest of Zara was the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
of this long struggle. The frontier fluctuated during
the whole of the thirteenth century; early in the
fourteenth the whole coast was again Venetian.
Meanwhile the republic was striving to make good
her position further south. The Epeirot despotat
long hindered her establishment either on the coasts
or the islands of northern Greece.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>History of
Corfu.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The famous
island of Korkyra or Corfu has a special history of its
own. No part of Greece has been so often cut off from
the Greek body. Under Pyrrhos and Agathoklês, no
less than under Michael Angelos and Roger, it obeyed
an Epeirot or a Sicilian master. It was among the
first parts of Greece to pass permanently under Roman
dependence.

In our own day Corfu was not added to
free Greece till long after the deliverance of Attica and
Peloponnêsos. But, under so many changes of foreign
masters, the island has always remained part of Europe
and of Christendom. Alone among the Greek lands,
Corfu has never passed under barbarian rule.

<p>The second Venetian occupation of Corfu was the

islands. But, during the hundred and eighty years
between the two occupations, the main fields of Venetian
action lay more to the north and more to the
south. The Greek acquisitions of the republic at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>

In the space of about

formed part of the Duchy of <i>Saint Sava</i>, and Hungary
kept part of the inland territory, with the fortress
of <i>Clissa</i>. The point where the Hadriatic coast turns

<i>Patras</i> was held for a few years, <i>Monembasia</i> was won,

<p>This marks an epoch in the history of Venice and of

Byzantine city in the Lagoons. The short occupation
of Thessalonikê may pass for the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>

Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

In Peloponnêsos <i>Modon</i> and <i>Koron</i> were lost along

<i>Nauplia</i> and <i>Monembasia</i>, together with all

The next war cost

and her two remaining Ægæan islands. She
now withdrew wholly to the western side of Greece,
where she had again won <i>Leukadia</i> and <i>Butrinto</i>,
and had enlarged her dominion by the acquisition of
<i>Prevesa</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
Venetian
dominion
in Greece
in the last
century.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
During the last century the Venetian possessions
in Greece consisted of the seven so-called Ionian
islands, with the continental posts of <i>Butrinto</i>, <i>Prevesa</i>,
and <i>Parga</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Venetian

<p>The Dalmatian territory of the Republic during the

the north-east, and of the whole coast down to <i>Budua</i>,
except where the territory of independent Ragusa
broke the continuity of her rule.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ragusan
frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Ragusa was so
jealous of the mightier commonwealth that she preferred
the Turk as a neighbour. At two points of the
coast, at <i>Klek</i> at the bottom of the gulf formed by the
long peninsula of Sabbioncello, and again at <i>Sutorina</i>
on the <i>Bocche</i>, the Ottoman territory came down to
the sea, so as to isolate the dominion of Ragusa from
the Venetian possessions on either side. Such was the
frontier of the two Hadriatic commonwealths down
to the days when, first Venice and then Ragusa, passed
away.</p>

cities.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">Meanwhile, besides the direct possessions of the
Venetian commonwealth, there were other lands within
the former dominions of the Eastern Empire which were
held by Venetian lords, as vassals either of the republic
or of the Empire of Romania. It would be endless to
trace out the revolutions of every Ægæan island; but
one among the few which claim our notice became the
seat of a dynasty which proved, next to the Venetian
commonwealth itself, the most long-lived Latin power
in the Greek world.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Duchy
of Naxos.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This is the duchy variously
known as that of <i>Naxos</i>, of the <i>Dôdekannêsos</i>, and
of the <i>Archipelago</i>, the barbarous name given to the
Ægæan or <i>White Sea</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1207.<br />
1566.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Founded in the early years
of Latin settlement by the Venetian Marco Sanudo,
the island duchy lived on as a Latin state, commonly
as a vassal or tributary state of some greater
power, till the last half of the sixteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Annexed

Turk,

1617.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Shorn of many of its islands by its Ottoman overlord,
granted afresh to a Jewish duke, it passed thirteen
years later under the immediate dominion of the Sultan.
Most of the <i>Kyklades</i> were either parts of this duchy
or fiefs held of it by other Venetian families. All came
into the hands of the Turk; but some of the very
smallest remained merely tributary, and not fully annexed,
into the seventeenth century.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlements

<p>The year which saw the Naxian duchy pass from
Latin to Hebrew hands saw the fall of the most remarkable
of the Genoese settlements in the Greek lands.
These settlements, like those of Venice, formed two
classes, those which were possessions of the Genoese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">{414}</a></span>
commonwealth itself and those which came into the
hands of Genoese citizens.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1304.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Genoa had no share in the
fourth Crusade; she had therefore no share in the
division of the Empire, though, after the restoration of
Byzantine rule, her colony of <i>Galata</i> made her almost
a sharer in the capital of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Possessions

But the seat
of direct Genoese dominion in the East was not the
Ægæan but the Euxine. On the southern coast of that
sea the republic held <i>Amastris</i> and <i>Amisos</i>, and in the
Tauric Chersonêsos was her great colony of <i>Kaffa</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1475.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Euxine dominion of Genoa came to an end during
the later half of the fifteenth century; but it outlived
the Empires both of Constantinople and of Trebizond.</p>

<p>The Ægæan dominion of the citizens of Genoa was
longer lived than the Euxine dominion of Genoa herself.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lesbos.
1354-1462.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The family of Gattilusio received <i>Lesbos</i> as an
Imperial fief in the fourteenth century, and kept it
till after the fall of Constantinople. But the most remarkable
Genoese settlement in the Ægæan was that
of <i>Chios</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Zaccaria

First held by princes of the Genoese house

India Company.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1566.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

<h3>§ 5. <i>The Principalities of the Greek Mainland.</i></h3>

<p>The Greek possessions of Venice, of Genoa, and of
the Knights of Saint John, consisted mainly of islands
and detached points of coast. The Venetian conquest of
Peloponnêsos was the only exception on a great scale.
In this they are distinguished from the several powers,
Greek and Frank, which arose on the Greek mainland.
We have already heard, and we shall hear again, of the
Greek despotat of Epeiros, which for a moment grew
into an Empire of Thessalonikê. Among the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
powers two rose to European importance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of
Athens.<br />
Principality
of Achaia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These are
the <i>duchy of Athens</i> in central Greece—in <i>Hellas</i>,
according to the Byzantine nomenclature—and the
principality of <i>Achaia</i> or <i>Môraia</i> in Peloponnêsos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
name
Môraia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last name, of uncertain origin,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> has come, in its
Italian shape, to be a modern name of the peninsula
itself. But the name of <i>Môraia</i> seems strictly to
belong to the domain lands of the principality, and
never to go beyond the bounds of the principality,
which at no time took in the whole of Peloponnêsos.</p>

<p class="pb2">Both these powers were founded in the first days
of the Latin conquest, and the Turk did not finally
annex the territories of either till after the fall of
Constantinople. But while the Athenian duchy lived
on to become itself the prize of Mahomet the Conqueror,
the lands of the Achaian principality had already
gone back into Greek hands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lordship of
Athens.
1204-1205.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The lordship of Athens,
founded by Otho de la Roche, was first a fief of the
kingdom of Thessalonikê, then of the Empire of Romania.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Duchy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it was by the grant of Saint Lewis of
France that the title of <i>Great Lord</i><a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> was exchanged
for that of <i>Duke</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1260.<br />
The Catalan
Conquest,
1311.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The duchy fell into the hands of the
Catalan Great Company, who in central Greece grew
from mere ravagers into territorial occupiers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Sicilian
Dukes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They
brought with them the Thessalian land of <i>Neopatra</i>, and
transferred the nominal title of <i>Duke of Athens and
Neopatra</i> to princes of the Sicilian branch of the House
of Aragon. Thus the two claimants of the Sicilian
crown were brought face to face on old Greek ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dukes of
the house of
Acciauoli.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The duchy next passed to the Florentine house of Acciauoli,
which already held Corinth, Megara, Sikyôn, and
the greater part of Argolis. But their Peloponnesian
dominion passed to the Byzantine lords of the peninsula,
and Neopatra fell into the hands of the Turk.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1390.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Athenian duchy itself, taking in Attica and Boiôtia,
lived on, the vassal in turn of the Angevin king at
Naples, of the Greek despot of Peloponnêsos, and of
the Ottoman Sultan.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ottoman

Annexed at last to the Ottoman
dominions, Athens remained in bondage till our own
day, save only two momentary occupations by Venice,
one soon after the first conquest, the other in the great
war of Morosini.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Salôna and
Bodonitza.<br /><hr />The Principality
of
Achaia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The smaller principalities of <i>Salôna</i> and <i>Bodonitza</i>
play their part in the history of the Athenian duchy;
but we turn to the chief Latin power of Peloponnêsos,
the principality of Achaia. The shiftings of its dynasties
and feudal relations are endless; its geographical
history is simpler. The peninsula was, at the time
of the Latin conquest, already beginning to fall away
from the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1205.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
King Boniface of Thessalonikê
had to win the land from its Greek lord Leôn Sgouros.
The princes of the house of Champlitte and Villehardouin
were his vassals. They had to struggle with
the Venetian settlement in Messênia, and with the
Greek despot of Epeiros, who, oddly enough, held
Corinth, Argos, and Nauplia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1210-1212.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These last towns were
won by the Latins, and became an Achaian fief in the
hands of Otho of Athens.

1248.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before the end of half a
century, the conquest of the whole peninsula, save
the Venetian possessions, was completed by the taking
of <i>Monembasia</i>. Things looked as if, now that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
Latin power was waning at Constantinople, a stronger
Latin power had arisen in Peloponnêsos. A crowd of
Greek lands, Zakynthos, Naxos, Euboia, Athens, even
Epeiros and Thessalonikê, acknowledged at one time or
another the supremacy of Achaia. But Latin Achaia,
like Latin Constantinople, had to yield to revived
Greek energy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Recovery

The Empire won back the three Lacedæmonian

<p class="pb2">Before the end of the century the Frank principality
lost its independence. It passed into vassalage
to the Angevin crown, and was held, sometimes by the
Neapolitan kings themselves, sometimes by princes of
their house—some of them nominal Emperors of Romania—sometimes
by princes of Savoy, who carried
the Achaian name into Northern Italy.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dismemberment

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1358.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Both of these passed for a longer or a shorter
time under the power of Venice. Corinth and the

it might almost pass for an independent Greek
state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1381.<br />

Notwithstanding the inroads of the Navarrese,
the second Spanish invaders of Greece, and the first

till it took in all Peloponnêsos save the Venetian towns.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Successive

1685.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then
the Turk gradually gathered in the Venetian ports,
and the whole peninsula was his, save so far as <i>Maina</i>
kept on a kind of wild independence almost down
to the last Venetian conquest. The complete and
unbroken possession of all Peloponnêsos by the
Ottoman has never filled up the whole of any one
century.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Despotat of
Epeiros.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have seen how the despotat of Epeiros parted
away from the momentary Empire of Thessalonikê.
The despots, like their neighbours, often found it convenient
to acknowledge the overlordship of some other
power, Venice, Nikaia, Sicily, or Achaia. The boundaries
of their dominions were greatly cut short by the
advance of the restored Empire and by the cessions to
Manfred of Sicily.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dismemberment

A state was left which took in old
Epeiros, Akarnania, and Aitôlia, save the points on the
coast which were held by other powers. <i>Arta</i>, the old
<i>Ambrakia</i>, was, as in the days of Pyrrhos, its head.

Next the greater part of Thessaly,
and then Epeiros itself, were recovered by the Empire,
and then all gradually passed under the Servian power.
On the break-up of that power came a time of utter

This

real and abiding importance in the history of the Greek
nation. The advance of the Albanians was checked;
their settlements were thrust further north and further
south, while the Beneventan dominions became and remained
purely Greek.

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Empire
of
Trebizond.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lastly, we must not forget that Greek state which
outlived all the rest. Far away, on the furthest bounds
of the elder Empire, the Empire of <i>Trebizond</i> had the
honour of being the last remaining fragment of the
Eastern Roman power. The rule of the Grand Komnênos
survived the fall of Constantinople; it survived
the conquest of Athens and Peloponnêsos.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
the Empire.
1204.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have seen the origin and early history of this
power. After its western dominions passed to the Nicene
Emperors and Sinôpê to the Turk, the Trapezuntine
Empire was confined to the eastern part of the south
coast of the Euxine, stretching over part of Iberia, and
keeping the Imperial possessions in the Tauric Chersonêsos.
Sometimes independent, sometimes tributary to
Turks or Mongols, the power of Trebizond lived on
for nearly eighty years as a distinct and rival Roman
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Agreement
between
Constantinople
and
Trebizond,
1281.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then, when Constantinople was again in
Greek hands, John Komnênos of Trebizond was content
to acknowledge Michael Palaiologos as Emperor
of the Romans, and to content himself with the style
of ‘Emperor of all the East, of Iberia, and of <i>Perateia</i>.’
This last name means the <i>province beyond the sea</i>, in
the Tauric Chersonêsos or <i>Crim</i>. We thus see that
the style of ‘Emperor of the East,’ which it is sometimes
convenient to give to him of Constantinople,
strictly belongs to him of Trebizond. The new Empire
of the East suffered many fluctuations of territory,
chiefly at the hands of the neighbouring Turkomans.
<i>Chalybia</i>, the land of iron, was lost; the coast-line
was split asunder; the Empire bowed to Timour.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Turkish

But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>

The
outlying dependency of <i>Perateia</i> or <i>Gothia</i> was not
conquered till eleven years later still. As the Tauric
Chersonêsos had sheltered the last Greek commonwealth,
it sheltered also the last Greek principality.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>The Slavonic States.</i></h3>

<p>The Greek and Frank states of which we have just
been speaking arose, for the most part they directly
arose, out of the Latin partition of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
the partition
of the
Empire on
the Slavonic
states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On
the Slavonic powers the effect of that partition was
only indirect. Servia and Bulgaria had begun their
second career of independence before the partition.
The partition touched them only so far as the splitting
up of the Empire into a number of small states took away
all fear of their being again brought under its obedience.
In Croatia and Dalmatia all trace of the Imperial power
passed away. The Magyar held the inland parts; the
question was whether the Magyar or the Venetian
should hold the coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Servia and
Bulgaria.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The chief independent Slavonic powers were those
of <i>Servia</i> and <i>Bulgaria</i>. Of these, Servia represents
the unmixed Slave, as unmixed, that is, as any nation
can be; Bulgaria represents the Slave brought under
some measure of Turanian influence and mixture. The
history of the purer race is the longer and the more
brilliant. The Servian people made a longer resistance
to the Turk than the Bulgarian people; they were the
first to throw off his yoke; one part of them never submitted
to his yoke at all.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
Servia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The oldest Servia, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
have seen, stretched far beyond the bounds of the present
principality, and had a considerable Hadriatic sea-board,
though interrupted by the Roman cities. Among
the Zupans or princes of the many Servian tribes, the
chief were the northern Grand-Zupans of <i>Desnica</i> on
the Drina, and the southern Grand-Zupans of <i>Dioklea</i>
or <i>Rascia</i>, so called from their capital <i>Rassa</i>, the
modern <i>Novi-Bazar</i>. This last principality was the
germ of the historical kingdom of Servia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations
to the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But till the
fall of the old Empire, the Imperial claims over Servia
were always asserted and were often enforced.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1018.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Indeed
common enmity to the Bulgarian, the momentary conqueror
of Servia,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> formed a tie between Servia and
the Empire down to the complete incorporation of
Servia by Basil the Second.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1040.<br />
Conquest
by Manuel
Komnênos;
1148.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The successful revolt of
Servia made room for more than one claimant of Servian
dominion and kingship; but the Imperial claims remained,
to be enforced again in their fulness by Manuel
Komnênos. At last the Latin conquest relieved Servia
from all danger on the part of Constantinople; Servia
stood forth as an independent power under the kings
of the house of Nemanja.</p>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Bosnia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Even
before the last Imperial conquest, the Magyars had cut
away the western part of Servia, the land beyond the
Drina, known as <i>Bosnia</i> or <i>Rama</i>. Under the last
name it gave the Hungarian princes one of their royal
titles.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1286.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This land was more than once won back by
Servia; but its tendency was to separation and to
growth at the cost of Servia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1326.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the first half of the
fourteenth century, Bosnia was enlarged by the Servian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
lands bordering on the Dalmatian coast, the lands of
<i>Zachloumia</i> and <i>Terbounia</i>, which were never permanently
won back. So the lands on the Save, between
the Drina and the Morava, taking in the modern capital
of Belgrade, passed, in the endless shiftings of the
frontier, at one time to Bulgaria and at another to
Hungary.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Servian
advance
eastward
and southward.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Servia, thus cut short to the north and
west, was driven to advance southward and eastward,
at the expense of Bulgaria and of the powers which
had taken the place of the Empire on the lower Hadriatic
coast. From the latter part of the thirteenth
century onwards, Servia grew to be the greatest power
in the south-eastern peninsula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her seaboard.
1296.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Shorn of her old Hadriatic

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1319-1322.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Durazzo itself twice fell into Servian hands; but at

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reign of
Stephen

That highest power was reached in the reign
of Stephen Dushan, who spread his dominions far
indeed at the cost of Greeks and Franks, at the cost
of his old Slavonic neighbours and of the rising powers
of Albania. In the new Servian capital of <i>Skopia</i>, <i>Skoupi</i>,
or <i>Skopje</i>, the Tzar Stephen took an Imperial crown as
<i>Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1346.<br />
The

Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The new Empire
stretched uninterruptedly from the Danube to the
Corinthian gulf. At one end Bosnia was won back;
at the other end the Servian rule was spread over
Aitôlia and Thessaly, over Macedonia and Thrace as
far as <i>Christopolis</i>. It only remained to give a head to
this great body, and to make New Rome the seat of
the Servian power.</p>

death of the great Servian Tzar; and before he died,
the Ottoman was already in Europe. In fact the historical
result of the great advance of Servia was to
split up the whole of the Greek and Slavonic lands,
and to leave no power of either race able to keep out
the barbarian. We have seen how the titles of Stephen’s
Empire lived for a generation in the Greek part
of his dominions.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In Macedonia and Thrace several

<p>The history of <i>Bosnia</i>, as a really separate power,

of the momentary Servian Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its origin,

The Ban Stephen
Tvartko became the first king of the last Bosnian dynasty,
under the nominal superiority of the Hungarian crown.
Thus, at the very moment of the coming of the Turk, a
kingdom of Latin creed and associations became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
first power among the south-eastern Slaves. For a while
it seemed as if Bosnia was going to take the place which
had been held by Servia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greatest

Bosnia,

The Bosnian kingdom at
its greatest extent took in all the present Bosnia and
Herzegovina, with, it would seem, all Dalmatia except
Zara, and the north-west corner of Servia stretching
beyond the Drina. But the Bosnian power was broken
at Kossovo as well as that of Servia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
Jayce, 1391.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the time of
confusion which followed, Jayce in the north-west
corner became a power connected with both Hungary
and Bosnia, while the Turk established himself in
the extreme south. The Turk was driven out for
a while, but the kingdom was dismembered to form
a new Latin power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of

The Lord of the old Zachloumia,
a Bosnian vassal, transferred his homage to the
Austrian king of the Romans, and, became sovereign
Duke of <i>Saint Sava</i>, perhaps rather of <i>Primorie</i>. Thus
arose the state of <i>Herzegovina</i>, that is the <i>Duchy</i>, commemorating
in its half-German name the relation of
its prince to the Western Empire. But neither kingdom
nor duchy was long-lived.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1449.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The next year the duchy became tributary,

But in the long struggle between Venice and the Turk
various parts of its territory, especially the coast, came
under the power of the Republic.</p>


<p class="p2">Meanwhile one small Slavonic land, one surviving

independence through all changes.</p>

<p>In the break-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>

For a moment its

but the new state was
cut short on all sides by Bosnia, Venice, and the
Turk, and Skodra itself was sold to Venice. In the
middle of the fifteenth century, the state took a more

a new dynasty, that of Tzernojevich.

The last prince of the
dynasty resigned his power to the metropolitan bishop,
and Montenegro remained an independent state under
its Vladikas or hereditary prelates, till their dominion
was in our own time again exchanged for that of
temporal princes. During all this time the territory
of Montenegro was simply so much of the mountain
region as could maintain its independence against
the ceaseless attacks of the Turk. Yet Montenegro,
as the ally of England and Russia, bore her part
in the great European struggle, and won for herself
a haven and a capital at Cattaro.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1813.<br />

Her allies
stood by while Cattaro was filched by the Austrian;

In the latest times the Montenegrin

lost territory to the east, including part of the old seaboard
as far as <i>Dulcigno</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1878.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then Western diplomacy drew
another frontier, which forbade any large incorporation
of the kindred Slavonic districts, while a small extension
was allowed in that part of the lost ancient territory
which had become Albanian. Of three havens won by
Montenegro in the war, <i>Dulcigno</i> has been given back
to the Turk.

Austria has been allowed to filch <i>Spizza</i>,
as she had before filched Ragusa and Cattaro. The
third haven, that of <i>Antivari</i>, was left to those who
had won it under such restrictions as armed wrong
knows how to impose on the weaker power of right.</p>

kingdom which won its independence of the

that time to the Turkish conquest, one or more Bulgarian
states always existed. And throughout the

<h3>§ 7. <i>The Kingdom of Hungary.</i></h3>

<p>The origin of the Hungarian kingdom and the
reasons for dealing with along with the states which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">{432}</a></span>
arose out of the break-up of the Eastern Empire have
already been spoken of.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
of the
Hungarian
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Finnish conquerors of
the Slave, admitted within the pale of Western Christendom,
founding a new Hungary on the Danube and
the Theiss while they left behind them an older Hungary
on the Kama, have points of contact at once with
Asia and with both Eastern and Western Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its position
in south-eastern
Europe.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But,
as closely connected in their history with the nations
of the south-eastern peninsula, as sharers in the bondage
and in the deliverance of Servia, Greece, and Bulgaria,
in our geographical survey they claim a place
where they may be looked at strictly as part of the
south-eastern world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
the Magyar
invasion.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It has been already noticed<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> that the main geographical
work of the Magyar was to cut off that south-eastern
world, the world where the Greek and the
Slave, struggling for its supremacy, were both swallowed
up by the Ottoman, from the Slavonic region
between the Carpathians and the Baltic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Great
Moravia.
884-894.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the moment
of the Magyar inroad, the foundation of the
<i>Great-Moravian</i> kingdom, the kingdom of Sviatopluk,
made it more likely than it has ever been since that
the Slaves of the two regions might be united into a
single power. That kingdom, stretching to Sirmium,
marched on the north-western dependencies of the
Eastern Empire, while on the north it took in the Chrobatian
land which was afterwards Little Poland. Such
a power might have been dangerous to both Empires at
once; but the invaders whom the two Emperors called
in proved far more dangerous than Great Moravia could
ever have been. The Magyars, Ogres, or Hungarians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
the Turks of the Imperial geographer,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> were
called in by his father Leo to check the Bulgarians,
as they were called in by Arnulf in the West to check
the new power of Moravia. They passed, from the
north rather than from the east, into the land which
was disputed between Moravian and Bulgarian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>906.
Relations
between
Hungary
and Germany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
Moravian power was overthrown, and the Magyars,
stepping into its place, became constant invaders of
both Empires and their dependent lands. But to the
west, the victories of the Saxon kings put a check to
their inroads, and, save some shiftings on the Austrian
march, the frontier of Germany and Hungary has been
singularly abiding.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The two
Chrobatias
separated
by the
Magyars.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the Magyar settlement placed a barrier between
the two chief regions of the Slavonic race as a
whole, it specially placed a barrier between the two divisions
of the <i>Croatian</i> or <i>Chrobatian</i> people, those on the
Vistula and those on the Drave and Save.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1025.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The northern
<i>Chrobatia</i> still reached south of the Carpathians, and
it was not until the eleventh century that the Magyar
kingdom, by the acquisition of its southern part, gained
a natural frontier which, with some shiftings, served to
part it off from the Slavonic powers to the north of it.
To the south-east an uncultivated and wooded tract
separated the Magyar territory from the lands between
the Carpathians and the lower Danube which were still
held by the Patzinaks.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geographical
position
of the
Magyars.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The oldest Magyar settlement
thus occupied the central part of the modern kingdom,
on the Theiss and the middle Danube. There the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span>
Turanian invaders formed a ruling and central race,
within a Slavonic fringe at each end. There were
northern and southern Croats, <i>Slovaks</i> to the north,
and <i>Ruthenians</i> to the north-west, towards the kindred
land of <i>Halicz</i> or <i>Red Russia</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hungary a
kingdom:
its growth.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Hungary, ranking from the beginning of the eleventh
century as a kingdom of Latin Christendom, presently
grew in all directions. We have just seen its advance
at the expense of the northern Chrobatian land. Its
advance at the expense of the southern branch of that
race, and of the other Slavonic lands which owed more
or less of allegiance to the Eastern Empire, was still
more marked.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hungary
and Croatia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All these lands at one time or another
gave royal titles to the King of Hungary, King also of
Croatia, of Dalmatia, of Rama, even of Bulgaria. But in
most of these lands the Hungarian kingship was temporary
or nominal; in Croatia alone, though the frontier
has often shifted, Hungarian rule has been abiding.
Croatia has never formed an independent state since the
first Hungarian conquest; it has never been fully wrested
from Hungary since the days of Manuel Komnênos. In
those days it was indeed a question whether Hungary
itself had not an overlord in the Eastern Emperor.
After the great Bulgarian revolt that question could
never be raised again. But the Hungarian frontier was
ever shifting towards the former lands of the Empire,
Venetian, Servian, and Bulgarian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom of
Slavonia.
1492.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
One part of the old
Croatian kingdom, the land between Save and Drave,
was cut off to form, first an appanage, then an annexed
kingdom, by the special name of <i>Slavonia</i>, a name
shared by it with lands on the Baltic, perhaps on the
Ægæan.</p>

<p>But, from the first days of its conversion, the Hungarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
realm began to advance in other directions, in
lands which had formed no part of the Empire since
the days of Aurelian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Transsilvania
or
<i>Siebenbürgen</i>.<br />
1004.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before their Chrobatian conquest,
the Magyars passed the boundary which divided them
from the Patzinaks, and won the land which from its
position took the name of <i>Transsilvania</i>.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Colonists
were invited to settle in the thinly inhabited land. One
chief settlement was of the Low-Dutch speech from
Saxony and Flanders.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Various
colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another element was formed
by the Turanian <i>Szeklers</i>, whose Latin form of <i>Siculi</i>
might easily mislead. Another migration brought back
the name and speech of the Old Rome to the first land
from which she had withdrawn her power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
the Roumans.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The legendary belief in the unbroken life of the
Roman name and speech in the lands north of the
Danube is merely a legendary belief.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> There can be no
reasonable doubt that the present principality of Roumania
and the Rouman lands beyond its borders derived
their present population and language from a settlement
of the Rouman people further south. South of the
Danube, the Rouman or Vlach population, scattered
among Greeks, Slaves, and Albanians, at many points
from Pindos northwards, has kept its distinct nationality,
but it has never formed a political whole.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their
Northern
migration.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But a
migration beyond the Danube enabled the Roumans in
course of time to found two distinct principalities, and
to form a chief element in the population of a third.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
There is no sign of any Rouman population north of
the Danube before the thirteenth century. The events
of that century opened a way for a reversal of the
ordinary course of migration, for the settlement of lands
beyond the Empire by former subjects of the Empire.</p>

Then the
storm of Mongolian invasion, which crushed Hungary
itself for a moment, crushed the Cuman power for

within the Magyar realm, and gave its king yet another
title, that of <i>King of Cumania</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rouman

The former Cuman
land now lay open to new settlers, and the Rouman part
of the inhabitants of the new Bulgaria began to cross the
Danube into that land and the neighbouring districts.
In the course of the thirteenth century they occupied
the present Wallachia, and already formed an element
in the mixed population of Transsilvania. A Rouman
state thus began to be formed, which took the name
by which the Roumans were known to their neighbours.

sides of the Aluta.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Little

of Transsilvania, founded the principality of <i>Moldavia</i>
between the Carpathians and the Dniester. This too
stood to the Hungarian crown in the same shifting
relation as Great Wallachia, and sometimes transferred
its vassalage to Lithuania and Poland.</p>

a strip of north-western Hungary, including <i>Pressburg</i>.
The whole central part of the kingdom passed under

land south of those rivers, passed again to the Turk, and

from
Poland.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">The later acquisitions of the House of Austria were
made in the character of Hungarian kings, but they
did not lead to any enlargement of the Hungarian
kingdom. Thus the claim to the Austrian acquisitions
made at the first and third partitions of Poland,
rested solely on the two Hungarian occupations of
Red Russia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Galicia
and Lodomeria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Under the softened forms of <i>Galicia</i>
and <i>Lodomeria</i>, the Red Russian lands of <i>Halicz</i>
and <i>Vladimir</i>, together with part of Poland itself,
became a new kingdom of the House of Habsburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
as the greater part of the territory thus won still remains.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Acquisition
of Bukovina.
1776-1786.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Between the two partitions the new kingdom
was increased by the addition of <i>Bukovina</i>, the north-western
corner of Moldavia, which was claimed as an
ancient part of the Transsilvanian principality. It was
again only in its Hungarian character that the House of
Habsburg could make any claim to Dalmatia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dalmatia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Certainly
no Austrian duke had ever reigned over Dalmatia,
Red Russia, or the Rouman principalities. Yet in the
present dual arrangement of the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy the so-called <i>triple kingdom</i> of Croatia, Dalmatia,
and Slavonia, is divided between the rule of
Pest and the rule of Vienna. Galicia also counts to
the Austrian, and not to the Hungarian, division of the
monarchy. All this is perhaps in harmony with the
generally anomalous character of the power of which
they form part.

It is hard to say in which
of his many characters the Hungarian King and
Austrian Archduke holds the lands of <i>Bosnia</i> and
<i>Herzegovina</i>, of which the Treaty of Berlin confers on
him, not the sovereignty, but the administration. They
might have been claimed by the Hungarian king in his
ancient character of King of Rama. But the formal
aspect of the transaction would seem rather to be that
he has, like his predecessors in the sixteenth century,
become the man of the Turk.</p>

<h3>§ 8. <i>The Ottoman Power.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Ottoman
Turks.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Last among the powers which among them supplanted
the Eastern Empire, comes the greatest and
most terrible of all, that which overthrew the Empire
itself and most of the states which arose out of its
ruins, and which stands distinguished from all the rest
by its abiding possession of the Imperial city. This is
the power of the Ottoman Turks.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their
special
character
as Mahometans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They stand distinguished
from all the other invaders of the European
mainland of the Empire by being Mahometan invaders.
The examples of Bulgaria and Hungary show that
Turanian invaders, as such, are not incapable of being
received into European fellowship. This could not be in
the case of a Mahometan power, bound by its religion to
keep its Christian subjects in the condition of bondmen.
The Ottomans could not, like the Bulgarians, be lost in
the greater mass of those whom they conquered.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preservation
of the
subject
nations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
this very necessity helped in some measure to preserve
the national being of the subject nations. Greeks,
Servians, Bulgarians, have under Ottoman rule remained
Greeks, Servians, and Bulgarians, ready to begin their
national career afresh whenever the time for independence
should come.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Comparison
with the
Saracen
power in
Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dominion of the Turk in
Eastern Europe answers, as a Mahometan dominion, to
the dominion of the Saracen in Western Europe. But
in everything, save the mere reckoning of years, it has
been far more abiding. The Mahometan dominion in
southern Spain did indeed last two hundred years
longer than Mahometan dominion has yet lasted in
any part of Eastern Europe. But the Saracen power
in the West began to fall back as soon as it was established,
and its last two hundred years were a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">{443}</a></span>
survival. The Ottomans underwent no considerable
loss of territory till more than four centuries and a
half after their first appearance in Asia, till more than
three centuries after their passage into Europe. Constantinople
has been Ottoman sixty years longer than
Toledo was Saracen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent
of the
Ottoman
dominion
compared
with the
Eastern
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Ottoman, possessor of the Eastern Rome, does
in a rough way represent the Eastern Roman in the
extent of his dominion. The dominions and dependencies
of the Sultans at the height of their power took
in, in Eastern Europe, in Asia, and in Africa, nearly
all that had formed part of the Empire of Justinian,
with a large territory, both in Europe and Asia, which
Justinian had not held. Justinian held nothing north
of the Danube; Suleiman held, as sovereign or as overlord,
a vast dominion from Buda to Azof. On the
other hand, no part of the dominions of Justinian in
Western Europe, save one city for one moment, ever
came under Ottoman rule. The Eastern Empire in the
year 800 was smaller than even the present reduced
dominion of the Turk. The Eastern Empire, at its
height in the eleventh century, held in Europe a
dominion far smaller than the dominion of the Turk in
the sixteenth century, far larger than his dominion
now. But in the essential feature of Byzantine geography,
the possession of Constantinople and of the
lands on each side of the Bosporos and Hellespont, the
Ottoman Sultan took the place of the Eastern Emperor,
and as yet he keeps it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
the Mongolian
advance.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">The history of the Eastern Empire, and that of the
Ottomans in connexion with it, was largely affected by
the movements of the Mongols in the further East.
Mongolian pressure weakened the Seljuk Turks, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">{444}</a></span>
allowed the growth of the Nicene Empire. Mongolian
invasions also led indirectly to the growth of the
Ottoman power, and at a later time they gave it its
greatest check.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Origin of
the Ottomans.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Ottomans grew out of a Turkish
band who served the Seljuk Sultan against the Mongols.
As his vassals, they began to be a power in Asia and to
harry the coasts of Europe. They passed into Europe,
and won a great European dominion far more quickly
than they had won their Asiatic dominion. This is the
special characteristic of the Ottoman power. Asiatic
in everything else, it is geographically European; most
of its Asiatic and all its African dominion was won
from an European centre.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Break-up
and reunion
of the
Ottoman
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Already a power in Europe,
but not yet in possession of the Imperial city, the
new Ottoman power was for a moment utterly broken
in pieces by the second flood of Mongol invasion. That
the shattered dominion came together again is an event
without a parallel in Eastern history. The restored
Ottoman power then won Constantinople, and from
Constantinople, as representing the fallen Empire, it won
back the lost dominion of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its permanence.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The permanence
of the Ottoman power, when Constantinople was
once won, is in no way wonderful. Even the unreclaimed
Asiatic, when he was once seated on the throne of the
New Rome, inherited his share of Rome’s eternity.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>First settlements
of
the Ottomans.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first settlements of the Ottoman Turks were
on the banks of the <i>Sangarios</i>, which gave them from
the beginning a threatening position towards Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1299.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By the end of the thirteenth century they were firmly
established in that region. In the first half of the fourteenth
they became the leading power in Western Asia.

In the last days of

few more years saw Amurath in his European capital of
Hadrianople, completely hemming Constantinople in.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ottoman
advance.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The second half of the fourteenth century was a time
of the most speedy Ottoman advance, and the amount of
real advance is by no means represented by the change
on the map. We have seen in the case of Servia, of
Greece, and of Hungary, that the course of Turkish
invasion commonly went through three stages. There
was first the time of mere plunder. Then came the
tributary stage, and lastly, the day of complete bondage.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bajazet
first Sultan,
1389-1402.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Under Bajazet, the first Ottoman prince who bore
the title of Sultan, the immediate Ottoman dominion in
Europe stretched from the Ægæan to the Danube. It
took in all Bulgaria, all Macedonia, Thessaly, and
Thrace, save only Chalkidikê and the district just round
Constantinople. Servia and Wallachia were dependent
states, as indeed was the Empire itself. Central and
southern Greece, Bosnia, Hungary, even Styria, were
lands open to plunder.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of
Angora.
1402.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This great dominion was broken in pieces by the
victory of Timour at Angora. It seemed that the
empire of the Ottoman had passed away like the empire
of the Servian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Break up of
the Ottoman
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The dominion of Bajazet was
divided among his sons and the princes of the dispossessed
Turkish dynasties. The Christian states had
a breathing-time, and the sons of Bajazet were glad to
give back to the Empire some important parts of its lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
territories.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reunited
under
Mahomet.
1413.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Ottoman power came together again
under Mahomet the First; but for nearly half a century
its advance was slower than in the half-century before.
The conquests of Mahomet and of Amurath the Second
lay mainly in the Greek and Albanian lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Thessalonikê.
1430.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Turk
now reached the Hadriatic, and the conquest of Thessalonikê
gave him a firmer hold on the Ægæan. Towards
Servia and Hungary he lost and he won again; he hardly
conquered.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mahomet
the Conqueror.
1451-1481.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was the thirty years of Mahomet the
Conqueror which finally gave the Ottoman dominion its
European position.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Constantinople.
1453.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From his first and greatest conquest
of the New Rome, he gathered in what remained,
Greek, Frank, and Slave. The conquest of the Greek
mainland, of Albania and Bosnia, the final conquest of
Servia, made him master of the whole south-eastern
peninsula, save only the points held by Venice and the
unconquered height of the Black Mountain. He began
to gather in the Western islands, and he struck the first
great blow to the Venetian power by the conquest of
Euboia. Around the Euxine he won the Empire of
Trebizond and the points held by Genoa. The great
mass of the islands and the few Venetian points on the
coast still escaped.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
his dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Otherwise Mahomet the Conqueror
held the whole European dominions of Basil the Second,
with a greater dominion in Asia than that of Manuel
Komnênos. From the Danube to the Tanais and beyond
it, he held a vast overlordship, over lands which had
obeyed no Emperor since Aurelian, over lands which
had never obeyed any Emperor at all. At last the
Mussulman lord of Constantinople seemed about to win
back the Italian dominion of its Christian lords.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Taking of
Otranto,
1480.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In
his last days, by the possession of Otranto, Mahomet
ruled west of the Hadriatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">{447}</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been deemed that the little cloud
which now lighted on Otranto would grow as fast
as the little cloud which a hundred and thirty years
before had lighted on Kallipolis. But Bajazet the
Second made no conquests save the points which were
won from Venice.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Syria
and Egypt.
1516-17.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Selim the First, the greatest conqueror
of his line against fellow Mahometans, had no leisure,

Christian ground.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests
of Suleiman.
1520-1566.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But under Suleiman the Lawgiver,
not only the overlordship but the immediate rule of

over wide European lands which had never obeyed its
Christian Emperors.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>His African
overlordship.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then too its Mussulman lords won
back at least the nominal overlordship of that African
seaboard which the first Mussulmans had rent away
from the allegiance of Constantinople. The greatest
conquest of Suleiman was made in Hungary; but he
also made the Ægæan an Ottoman sea. The early years
of his reign saw the driving of the Knights from Rhodes,
and the winning of their fortress of Halikarnassos, the
last European possession on Asiatic ground. His last
days saw the annexation of the Naxian duchy; at
an intermediate stage Venice lost her Peloponnesian
strongholds.

The conquests of the seventeenth

days, and, before that century was out, the Ottoman

<i>Crete</i> was now won; a few years
later <i>Kamienetz</i> and all <i>Podolia</i> were ceded to the Turk
by Poland. This was not absolutely his last European
acquisition, but it was his last acquisition of a great
province. The Ottoman dominion now covered a
wider space on the map than it had done at any earlier
moment. Suleiman in all his glory had not reigned
over Cyprus, Crete, and Podolia. The tide now turned
for ever.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Ottoman

From that time the Ottoman has, like his

gone back.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ottoman

1683-1699.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first great blow to the integrity and independence
of the Ottoman Empire was dealt in the war which was
ended by the Peace of Carlowitz. We have seen how
Hungary and Peloponnêsos were won back for Christendom;
so was Podolia. We have seen too how at the next
stage the Turk gained at one end and lost at the other,
winning back Peloponnêsos, winning Mykonos and
Tênos, but losing on the Save and the Danube. The
next stage shows the Ottoman frontier again in advance;
in our own day we have seen it again fall back. And
the change which has given Bosnia and Herzegovina
to the master of Dalmatia, Ragusa, and Cattaro has,
besides throwing back the frontier of the Turk, redressed
a very old geographical wrong.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of

Ever since
the first Slavonic settlements, the inland region of
northern Illyricum has been more or less thoroughly
cut off from the coast cities which form its natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">{449}</a></span>
outlets. Whatever may be the fate of those lands, the
body is again joined to the mouth, and the mouth to
the body, and we can hardly fancy them again severed.</p>


<p class="p2">The same arrangements which transferred the
‘administration’ of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the King
of Hungary and Dalmatia, have transferred another part
of the Ottoman dominion to a more distant European
power on terms which are still less easy to understand.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cyprus.
1878.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Greek island of <i>Cyprus</i> has passed to English rule;
but it is after a fashion which may imply that the conquest
of Richard of Poitou is held—not, it is to be hoped,
by the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, but possibly
by the Empress of India—as a tributary of the Ottoman
Sultan.</p>

<h3>§ 9. <i>The Liberated States.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lands liberated
from
the Ottoman.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The losses which the Ottoman power has undergone
at the hands of its independent neighbours, Russia,
Montenegro, and Austria or Hungary, must be distinguished
from the liberation of certain lands from
Turkish rule to form new or revived European states.
We have seen that the kingdom of Hungary and its
dependent lands might fairly come under this head,
and we have seen in what the circumstances of their
liberation differ from the liberation of Greece or Servia
or Bulgaria. But it is important to bear in mind
that the Turk had to be driven from Hungary, no less
than from Greece, Servia, and Bulgaria. If the Turk
has ruled at Belgrade, at Athens, and at Tirnovo, he
has ruled at Buda no less. All stand in the same
opposition to Tzetinje, where he has never ruled.</p>

<p>As the Servian people was the only one among the
south-eastern nations of which any part maintained its
abiding independence, so the enslaved part of the
Servian people was the first among the subject nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">{451}</a></span>
to throw off the yoke.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Ionian
Islands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the first attempt to form
anything like a free state in south-eastern Europe was
made among a branch of the Greek nation, in the so-called
<i>Ionian Islands</i>. But the form which the attempt
took was no lessening of the Turkish dominion, but its
increase.

changed very little since the later days of old Hellas.
At all these stages some other people has held the solid

But the boundary is so
drawn as to leave part of the old Servian land to the
Turk, and carefully to keep the frontiers of the Servian
and Montenegrin principalities apart. That is to say,
the Servian nation is split into four parts—Montenegro,
free Servia, Turkish Servia, and those Servian lands
which are, some under the ‘administration,’ some under
the acknowledged rule, of the King of Hungary and
Dalmatia.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The

<p>While Servia and Greece were under the immediate

being. The Turk named and deposed their
princes, but they never came under his direct rule.

free.

the Romance-speaking people of Eastern Europe, still a
scattered remnant in their older seats, have, in their
great colony on the Danube, won for themselves a
place among the nations of Europe.</p>


<p class="p2 pb2">Lastly, while Servia and Roumania have been

The Russian treaty of San Stefano
decreed a tributary principality of Bulgaria, whose boundaries
came most nearly to those of the third Bulgarian
kingdom at its greatest extent. But it was to have, what
no Bulgarian state had had before, a considerable
Ægæan sea-board. This would have had the effect of
splitting the immediate dominion of the Turk in two. It
would also have had the real fault of adding to Bulgaria
some districts which ought rather to be added to free
Greece.

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General
Survey.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We may end our survey of the south-eastern lands
by taking a general view of their geographical position
at some of the most important points in their history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>800.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of the eighth century we see the Eastern
Empire still stretching from Tauros to Sardinia; but
everywhere, save in its solid Asiatic peninsula, it has
shrunk up into a dominion of coasts and islands. It
still holds Sicily, Sardinia, and Crete, the heel and the
toe of Italy, the outlying duchies of Campania, the outlying
duchy at the head of the Hadriatic. In its great
European peninsula it holds the whole of the Ægæan
coast, a great part of the coasts of the Euxine and the
Hadriatic. But the lord of the sea rules nowhere far
from the sea; the inland regions are held, partly by
the great Bulgarian power, partly by smaller Slavonic
tribes fluctuating between independence and formal
submission.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>900.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of the next century the
general character of the East-Roman dominion remains
the same, but many points of detail have changed.
Sardinia and Crete are lost; a corner is all that is
left in Sicily; but the Imperial power is acknowledged
along the whole eastern Hadriatic coast; the heel and
the toe have grown into the dominion of all southern
Italy; all Greece has been won back to the Empire.
But the Empire has now new neighbours. The
Turanian Magyar is seated on the Danube, and other
kindred nations are pressing in his wake. Russians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">{456}</a></span>
Slaves that is under Scandinavian leadership, threaten the
Empire by sea.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1000.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The last year of the tenth century shows
Sicily wholly lost, but Crete and Cyprus won back;
Kilikia and Northern Syria are won again; Bulgaria is
won and lost again; Russian establishment on the Danube
is put off for eight hundred years; the great struggle
is going on to decide whether the Slave or the Eastern
Roman is to rule in the south-eastern peninsula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>c. 1040.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At
one moment in the eleventh century we see the
dominion of the New Rome at its full height. Europe
south of the Danube and its great tributaries, Asia to
Caucasus and almost to the Caspian, form a compact
body of dominion, stretching from the Venetian isles to
the old Phœnician cities. The Italian and insular
dominion is untouched; it is enlarged for a moment
by Sicilian conquest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>c. 1090.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another glance, half-a-century
later, shows the time when the Empire was most frightfully
cut short by old enemies and new. The Servian
wins back his own land; the Saracen wins back Sicily.
The Norman in Italy cuts down the Imperial dominion
to the nominal superiority of Naples, the last of Greek
cities in the West, as Kymê was the first. For a
moment he even plants himself east of Hadria, and
rends away Corfu and Durazzo from the Eastern world,
as Rome rent them away thirteen centuries before.
The Turk swallows up the inland provinces of Asia; he
plants his throne at Nikaia, and leaves to the Empire
no Asiatic dominion beyond a strip of Euxine and
Ægæan coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>c. 1180.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Towards the end of the twelfth century,
the Empire is restored to its full extent in Europe;
Servia and Dalmatia are won back, Hungary itself
looks like a vassal. In Asia the inland realm of the
Turk is hemmed in by the strong Imperial grasp of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">{457}</a></span>
whole coast-line, Euxine, Ægæan, and Mediterranean.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>c. 1200.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the next moment comes the beginning of the final
overthrow; before the century is out, the distant
possessions of the Empire have either fallen away of
themselves, or have been rent away by other powers.
Bulgaria, Cyprus, Trebizond, Corfu, even Epeiros and
Hellas, have parted away, or are in the act of parting
away.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1204.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Venice, its long nominal homage cast aside,
joins with faithless crusaders to split the Empire in
pieces. The Flemish Emperor reigns at Constantinople;
the Lombard King reigns at Thessalonikê; Achaia,
Athens, Naxos, give their names to more abiding
dynasties; Venice plants herself firmly in Crete and
Peloponnêsos. Still the Empire is not dead. The
Frank, victorious in Europe, hardly wins a footing in
Asia. Nikaia and Trebizond keep on the Imperial succession,
and a third Greek power, for a moment Imperial
also, holds it in Western Greece and the islands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1250.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Fifty years later, the Empire of Nikaia has become an
European power; it has already outlived the Latin
dominion at Thessalonikê; it has checked the revived
power of Bulgaria; it has cut short the Latin Empire
to the immediate neighbourhood of the Imperial city.
To the north Servia is strengthening herself; Bosnia is
coming into being; the Dalmatian cities are tossed to
and fro among their neighbours.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1300.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another glance at the
end of the thirteenth century shows us the revived East-Roman
Empire in its old Imperial seat, still in Europe
an advancing and conquering power, ruling on the
three seas of its own peninsula, established once more in
Peloponnêsos, a compact and seemingly powerful state,
as compared with the Epeirot, Achaian, and Athenian
principalities, or with the scattered possessions of Venice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">{458}</a></span>
in the Greek lands. But the power which seems so
firmly established in Europe has all but passed away in
Asia. There the Turk has taken the place of the Greek,
and the Greek the place of the Frank, as they stood a
hundred years earlier. And behind the immediate
Turkish enemies stands that younger and mightier
Turkish power which is to swallow up all its neighbours,
Mussulman and Christian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>c. 1354.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the central years
of the fourteenth century we see the Empire hemmed
in between two enemies, European and Asiatic, which
have risen to unexpected power at the same time.
Part of Thrace, Chalkidikê, part of Thessaly, a few
scattered points in Asia, are left to the Empire; in
Peloponnêsos alone is it an advancing power; everywhere
else its frontiers have fallen back. The Servian
Tzar rules from the Danube to the Gulf of Corinth.
The Ottoman Emir has left but a few fragments to the
Empire in Asia, and has already fixed his grasp on
Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1400.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before the century is ended, neither Constantinople,
nor Servia, nor any other Christian power, is
dominant in the south-eastern peninsula. The Ottoman
rules in their stead. The Empire is cut short to a
corner of Thrace, with Thessalonikê, Chalkidikê, and
the Peloponnesian province which now forms its greatest
possession. Instead of the great power of Servia, we
see a crowd of small principalities, Greek, Slavonic,
and Albanian, falling for the most part under either
Ottoman or Venetian supremacy. The Servian name
is still borne by one of them; but its prince is a
Turkish vassal; the true representative of Servian independence
has already begun to show itself among the
mountains which look down on the mouths of Cattaro
and the lake of Skodra. Bulgaria has fallen lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">{459}</a></span>
still; the Turk’s immediate power reaches to the
Danube. Bosnia at one end, the Frank principalities
at the other end, the Venetian islands in either sea, still
hold out; but the Turk has begun, if not to rule over
them, at least to harry them. Within the memory of
men who could remember when the Empire of Servia
was not yet, who could remember when the eagles of
Constantinople still went forth to victory, the Ottoman
had become the true master of the South-Eastern lands;
whatever has as yet escaped his grasp remained simply
as remnants ready for the gleaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>1500.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We will take our next glance in the later years
of the fifteenth century, a few years after the death of
the great conqueror. The momentary break-up of
the power of the Ottoman has been followed by the
greatest of his conquests. All now is over. The New
Rome is the seat of barbarian power. Trebizond,
Peloponnêsos, Athens, Euboia, the remnant of independent
Epeiros, Servia, Bosnia, Albania, all are gathered
in. The islands are still mostly untouched; but the
whole mainland is conquered, save where Venice still
holds her outposts, and where the warrior prelates of
the Black Mountain, the one independent Christian
power from the Save to Cape Matapan, have entered on
their career of undying glory. With these small exceptions,
the whole dominion of the Macedonian Emperors
has passed into Ottoman hands, together with a vast
tributary dominion beyond the Danube, much of which
had never bowed to either Rome.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1600.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of another
century, we see all Hungary, save a tributary remnant,
a subject land of the Turk. We see Venice shorn of
Cyprus and all her Peloponnesian possessions. The
Dukes have gone from Naxos and the Knights from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">{460}</a></span>
Rhodes, and the Mussulman lord of so many Christian
lands has spread his power over his fellow Mussulmans
in Syria, Egypt, and Africa.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1700.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Another century passes,
and the tide is turned. The Turk can still conquer; he
has won Crete abidingly and Podolia for a moment.
But the crescent has passed away for ever from Buda
and from the Western isles; it has passed away for a
moment from Corinth and all Peloponnêsos.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1800.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the
end of another century we see the Turk’s immediate
possession bounded by the Save and the Danube, and
his overlordship bounded by the Dniester. His old
rivals Poland and Venice are no more; but Austria
hems in his Slavonic provinces; France struggles for
the islands off his western shore; Russia watches him
from the peninsula so long held by the free Goth and
the free Greek.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1878.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Seventy-eight years more, and his
shadow of overlordship ends at the Danube, his shadow
of immediate dominion ends at the Balkan. Free
Greece, free Servia, free Roumania—Montenegro again
reaching to her own sea—Bulgaria parted into three,
but longing for reunion—Bosnia, Herzegovina, Cyprus,
held in a mysterious way by neighbouring or distant
European powers—all join to form, not so much a
picture as a dissolving view. We see in them a transitional
state of things, which diplomacy fondly believes
to be an eternal settlement of an eternal question, but
of which reason and history can say only that we
know not what a day may bring forth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Long after this chapter was written, after the whole of it was
printed, after a great part of it was revised for the press, there appeared
the first volume of the great collection of C. N. Sathas,
Μνημεῖα τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς Ἱσορίας, <i>Documents Inédits relatifs à
l’Histoire de la Grèce au Moyen Âge</i> (Paris, 1880). In his preface
M. Sathas insists on two points. One is the Greek character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">{461}</a></span>
Eastern Empire throughout its whole being; that it had a Greek
side no one ever thought of denying. He brings together a good
many occasional instances, largely from unprinted manuscripts, of
the use of Ἕλλην and Ἑλλάς through the whole period of the
Empire. That the name came into rhetorical use by a kind of
<i>Renaissance</i> about the thirteenth century is undoubted. I brought
together some few instances in my Historical Essays, iii. 246, and the
whole history of Laonikos Chalkokondylas is one long instance. M.
Sathas brings several others from much earlier times. But they
seem to me to be mainly cases of the rhetorical use of an antiquated
name, such as is common among all nations. They do not seem to
affect the proposition that the regular national name of the Empire
and its people was always <i>Roman</i>. M. Sathas’ other point is somewhat
startling. It is that the Slavonic occupation of a large part of
Greece, as to the extent of which there has been much disputing,
but which I never before saw altogether denied, is all a mistake.
According to him the settlers were not Slaves, but Albanians, called
Slaves by that lax use of national names of which there certainly
are plenty of instances. I cannot undertake either to accept or to
refute M. Sathas’ doctrine during the process of revising a proof-sheet.
I can only put the fact on record that one who has gone very deeply
into the matter has come to this, to me at least, altogether new
conclusion.]</p></div>

Scandinavia has been of far greater relative importance
than the Mediterranean side of Spain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
Aragon in
the Mediterranean.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of the three chief
Spanish kingdoms Aragon alone has a Mediterranean
history; the seaward course of Castile and Portugal
was oceanic. Of the three Scandinavian kingdoms
Norway alone is wholly oceanic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
Sweden in
the Baltic.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Denmark is more
Baltic than oceanic; the whole historic life of Sweden
lies on the Baltic coasts. The Mediterranean position
of Aragon enabled her to win whole kingdoms as
her dependencies. But they were not geographically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">{464}</a></span>
continuous, and they never could be incorporated.
Sweden, on the other hand, was able to establish a
continuous dominion on both sides of the great northern
gulfs, and to make at least a nearer approach to the
incorporation of her conquests than Aragon could ever
make.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth
and decline
of Sweden.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The history of Sweden mainly consists in the
growth and the loss of her dominion in the Baltic lands
out of her own peninsula. It is only in quite modern
times that the union of the crowns, though not of
the kingdoms, of Sweden and Norway has created
a power wholly peninsular and equally Baltic and
oceanic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eastern
and
western aspects
of
Scandinavia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This eastern aspect of Scandinavian history needs the
more to be insisted on, because there is another side of it
with which we are naturally more likely to be struck.
Scandinavian inroads and conquests—inroads and conquests,
that is, from Denmark and Norway—make
up a large part of the early history of Gaul and Britain.
When this phase of their history ends, the Scandinavian
kingdoms are apt to pass out of our sight, till we are
perhaps surprised at the great part which they suddenly
play in Europe in the seventeenth century. But both
Denmark and Sweden had meanwhile been running
their course in the lands north, east, and south of the
Baltic. And it is this Baltic side of their history which
is of primary importance in our general European
view.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Baltic
lands generally.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It follows then that, for the purposes of our present
survey, while the British islands and the Spanish peninsula
will each claim a distinct treatment, we cannot
separate the Scandinavian peninsulas from the general
mass of the Baltic lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Northern
Slavonic
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We must look at Scandinavia
in close geographical connexion with the region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">{465}</a></span>
which stretches from the centre to the extreme east of
Europe, a region which, while by no means wholly Slavonic,
is best marked as containing the seats of the
northern branch of the Slavonic race. This region has a
constant connexion with both German and Scandinavian
history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Germanized
Slavonic
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It takes in those wide lands, once Slavonic,
which have at various times been more or less
thoroughly incorporated with Germany, but which did
not become German without vigorous efforts to make
large parts of them Scandinavian. In another part of
our survey we have watched them join on to the
Teutonic body; we must now watch them drop off
from the Slavonic body.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Northern
Slaves
under
Hungary
or Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And with them we must take
another glimpse at those among the Northern Slaves who
passed under the power of the Magyar, and of that composite
dominion which claims the Magyar crown among
many others. These North-Slavonic lands which have
passed to non-Slavonic rulers form a region stretching
from Holstein to the Austrian kingdom of Galicia
and Lodomeria and to the Slovak and Ruthenian districts
of Hungary. But above all, this North-Slavonic
region takes in those two branches of the Slavonic race
which have in turn lorded it over one another, neither
of which passed permanently under the lordship of
either Empire, but one of which owed its unity and
national life to settlers from the Scandinavian north.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Characteristics
of
Poland and
Russia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
That is to say, it is the land of the Pole and the Russian,
the land of the two branches of the Slavonic race which
passed severally under the spiritual dominion of the
elder and the younger Rome without passing under the
temporal dominion of either.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
primitive
nations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And within the same
region we have to deal with the remnant that is left of
those ancient nations, Aryan and non-Aryan, which so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">{466}</a></span>
long refused all obedience to either Church as well as to
either Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Aryan
nations;
Prussians
and Lithuanians.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The region at which we now look takes
in the land of those elder brethren of the European
family whose speech has changed less than any other
European tongue from the Aryan speech once common to
all. Alongside of the Orthodox Russian, of the Catholic
Pole, of the Swede first Catholic and then Lutheran, we
have to look on the long abiding heathendom of the
Lithuanian and the Prussian.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Non-Aryan
Fins.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And at their side we
have to look on older races still, on the præ-Aryan
nations on either side of the Bothnian and Finnish gulfs.
The history of the eastern coast of the Baltic is the
history of the struggle for the rule or the destruction of
these ancient nations at the hands of their Teutonic
and Slavonic neighbours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Central
position of
the North-Slavonic
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The whole North-Slavonic region, north-eastern
rather than central with regard to Europe in general,
has still a central character of its own. It is connected
with the history of northern, of western, and
of south-eastern Europe. The falling away of so
many Slavonic lands to Germany is of itself no small
part of German history. But besides this, the strictly
Polish and Russian area marches at once on the
Western Empire, on the lands which fringe the Eastern
Empire, on the Scandinavian North, and on the barbarian
lands to the north-east. This last feature is a
characteristic both of the North-Slavonic region and of
the Scandinavian peninsula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Barbarian
neighbours
of Russia
and Scandinavia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Norway, Sweden, Russia,
are the only European powers whose land has always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">{467}</a></span>
marched on the land of barbarian neighbours, and have
therefore been able to conquer and colonize in barbarian
lands simply by extending their own frontiers. This
was done by Norway and Sweden as far as their geographical
position allowed them; but it has been done on
a far greater scale by Russia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Russian
conquest
and colonization
by land.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
While other European
nations have conquered and colonized by sea, Russia,
the one European state of later times which has marched
upon Asia, has found a boundless field for conquest and
colonization by land. She has had her India, her
Canada, and her Australia, her Mexico, her Brazil, her
Java, and her Algeria, geographically continuous with
her European territory. This fact is the key to much
in the later history of Russia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relation of
the Baltic
lands to
the two
Empires.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>With regard to the two Empires, the lands round
the Baltic show us several relations.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Norway
always independent.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Scandinavia,
Norway stands alone in never having had anything to
do with the Roman power in any of its forms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations
of Sweden
and Denmark
to the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Sweden
itself has always been equally independent; but in later
times Swedish kings have held fiefs within the Western
Empire. The position of Denmark has naturally caused
it to have much more to do with its Roman or German
neighbour. In earlier times some Danish kings became
vassals of the Empire for the Danish crown; others
made conquests within the lands of the Empire. In
later times Danish kings have held fiefs within the
German kingdom and have been members of the more
modern Confederation.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Empire
and the
West-Slavonic
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The western parts of the Slavonic
region became formally part of the Western Empire.
But this was after the Empire had put on the character
of a German state; these lands were not drawn to it from
its strictly Imperial side.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Poland and
the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Poland sometimes passed in
early days for a fief of the German kingdom; in later days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">{468}</a></span>
it was divided between the two chief powers which
arose out of that kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations
of Russia
to the
Eastern
Church and
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Russia, on the other hand,
the pupil of the Eastern Empire, has never been the
subject or the vassal of either Empire. When Russia
had an external overlord, he was an Asiatic barbarian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Imperial
style of
Russia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The peculiar relation between Russia and Constantinople,
spiritual submission combined with temporal independence,
has led to the appearance in Russia of Imperial
ideas and titles with a somewhat different meaning from
that with which they were taken in Spain and in
Britain. The Russian prince claims the Imperial style
and bearings, not so much as holding an Imperial
position in a world of his own, as because the most
powerful prince of the Eastern Church in some sort
inherits the position of the Eastern Emperor in the
general world of Europe.</p>


<h3>§ 1. <i>The Scandinavian Lands after the Separation of the Empires.</i></h3>

<p>At the end of the eighth century the Scandinavian
and Slavonic inhabitants of the Baltic lands as yet
hardly touched one another. The most northern
Scandinavians and the most northern Slaves were still
far apart; if the two races anywhere marched on one
another, it must have been at the extreme south-western
corner of the Baltic coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Baltic
still
mainly
held by the
earlier
races.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The greater part of that
coast, all its northern and eastern parts, was still held
by the earlier nations, Aryan and non-Aryan.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formation
of the
Scandinavian
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But,
within the two Scandinavian peninsulas, the three
Scandinavian nations were fast forming. A number
of kindred tribes were settling down into the kingdoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">{469}</a></span>
of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> which,
sometimes separate, sometimes united, have existed
ever since.</p>

<p>Of these three, Denmark, the only one which had
a frontier towards the Empire, was naturally the first to
play a part in general European history.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formation
of the
Danish
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the course
of the tenth century, under the half-mythical Gorm and
his successors Harold and Sven, the Danish kingdom
itself, as distinguished from other lands held in after
times by its kings, reached nearly its full historical
extent in the two peninsulas and the islands between
them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Denmark
in the
northern
peninsula.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Halland</i> and <i>Skåne</i> or <i>Scania</i>, it must always be
remembered, are from the beginning at least as Danish
as Zealand and Jutland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Frontier
of the
Eider.<br />
The
Danish
March.
934-1027.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Eider remained the frontier
towards the Empire, save during part of the tenth and
eleventh centuries, when the Danish frontier withdrew
to the Dannewerk, and the land between the two
boundaries formed the <i>Danish March</i> of the Empire.
Under Cnut the old frontier was restored.</p>

<p>The name of <i>Northmen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> which the Franks used in
a laxer way for the Scandinavian nations generally, was
confined to the people of <i>Norway</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formation
of the
kingdom of
Norway.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were formed
into a single kingdom under Harold Harfagra late in
the ninth century. The Norwegian realm of that day
stretched far beyond the bounds of the later Norway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">{470}</a></span>
having an indefinite extension over tributary Finnish
tribes as far as the White Sea. The central part of
the eastern side of the northern peninsula, between
Denmark to the south and the Finnish nations to
the north, was held by two Scandinavian settlements
which grew into the Swedish kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Swedes and
<i>Gauts</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were
those of the Swedes strictly so called, and of the
<i>Geátas</i> or <i>Gauts</i>. This last name has naturally been
confounded with that of the Goths, and has given
the title of <i>King of the Goths</i> to the princes of
Sweden. <i>Gothland</i>, east and west, lay on each side of
Lake Wettern. <i>Swithiod</i> or <i>Svealand</i>, Sweden proper,
lay on both sides of the great arm of the sea whose
entrance is guarded by the modern capital.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Swedish
kingdom.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The union
of Svealand and Gothland made up the kingdom of
Sweden.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations
towards
Norway
and Denmark.
1111.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Its early boundaries towards both Denmark
and Norway were fluctuating. <i>Wermeland</i>, immediately
to the north of Lake Wenern, and <i>Jamteland</i> farther to
the north, were long a debateable land. At the beginning
of the twelfth century Wermeland passed finally
to Sweden, and Jamteland for several ages to Norway.
<i>Bleking</i> again, at the south-east corner of the peninsula,
was a debateable land between Sweden and Denmark
which passed to Denmark.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth to
the north.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
For a land thus bounded
the natural course of extension by land lay to the
north, along the west coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. In
the course of the eleventh century at the latest, Sweden
began to spread itself in that direction over <i>Helsingland</i>.</p>

<p>Sweden had thus a better opportunity than Denmark
and Norway for extension of her own borders by land.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Western
expeditions
of the
Danes and
Northmen.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile Denmark and Norway, looking to the west,
had their great time of Oceanic conquest and colonization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">{471}</a></span>
in the ninth and tenth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> These two processes
must be distinguished.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquests.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Some lands, like the
Northumbrian and East-Anglian kingdoms in Britain and
the duchy of Normandy in Gaul, received Scandinavian
princes and a Scandinavian element in their population,
without the geographical area of Scandinavia being
extended.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But that area may be looked on as being extended
by colonies like those of <i>Orkney</i>, <i>Shetland</i>,
<i>Faroe</i>, the islands off the western coast of Scotland,
<i>Man</i>, <i>Iceland</i>, <i>Greenland</i>. Some of these were actually
discovered and settled for the first time by the Northmen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlements
in
Ireland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The settlements on the east coast of Ireland,
Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, may also pass as outposts
of Scandinavia on Celtic ground. Of these outlying
Scandinavian lands, some of the islands, specially
Iceland, have remained Scandinavian; the settlements
on the mainland of Britain and Ireland, and on the
islands nearest to them, have been merged in the British
kingdoms or have become dependencies of the British
crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Expedition
to the east.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Against this vast range of Oceanic settlement there
is as yet little to set in the form of Baltic conquest on
the part of Norway and Denmark. Norway indeed
hardly could become a Baltic power.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Danes in
Samland.
950.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But there was
a Danish occupation of <i>Samland</i> in Prussia in the tenth
century, which caused that land to be reckoned among
the kingdoms which made up the Northern Empire of
Cnut.<a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jomsburg.
935-1043.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There is also the famous settlement of the
<i>Jomsburg</i> Wikings at the mouth of the Oder. But the
great eastern extension of Danish power came later.
Nor did the lasting Swedish occupation of the lands
east of the gulf of Bothnia begin till the twelfth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">{472}</a></span>
But there is no doubt that, long before this, there were
Swedish inroads and occasional Swedish conquests in
other parts of the Baltic lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Swedish
conquest of
Curland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus <i>Curland</i> is said
to have been won for a while by Sweden, and to have
been again won back by its own Lettic people.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The
ninth century indeed saw a wonderful extension of
Scandinavian dominion far to the east and far to the
south. But it was neither ordinary conquest nor ordinary
settlement. No new Scandinavian people was
planted, as in Orkney and Iceland. Nor were Scandinavian
outposts planted, as in Ireland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Scandinavians
in
Russia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But Scandinavian
princes, who in three generations lost all trace of their
Scandinavian origin, created, under the name of <i>Russia</i>,
the greatest of Slavonic powers. The vast results of
their establishment have been results on the history and
geography of the Slaves; on Scandinavian geography
it had no direct effect at all. Still it forms a connecting
link between the Scandinavian lands west and north of
the Baltic and the Slavonic region to the east and south
of that sea.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>The Lands East and South of the Baltic at the Separation of the Empires.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slaves
between
Elbe and
Dnieper.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At the beginning of the ninth century the inland
region stretching from the Elbe a little beyond the
Dnieper was continuously held by various Slavonic
nations. Their land marched on the German kingdom
at one end, and on various Finnish and Turkish nations
at the other.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their lack
of sea-board.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But their sea-board was comparatively
small. Wholly cut off from the Euxine, from the
northern Ocean, and from the great gulfs of the Baltic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">{473}</a></span>
their only coast was that which reaches from the modern
haven of Kiel to the mouth of the Vistula. And this
Slavonic coast was gradually brought under German
influence and dominion, and has been in the end fully
incorporated with the German state. It follows then
that, in tracing the history of the chief Slavonic powers
in this region, of Bohemia, Poland, and Russia, we are
dealing with powers which are almost wholly inland.
At the time of the separation of the Empires, there was
no one great Slavonic power in these parts. One
such, with Bohemia for its centre, had shown itself for a
moment in the seventh century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bohemian
kingdom
of Samo.
623.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This was the kingdom
of Samo, which, if its founder was really of
Frankish birth, forms an exact parallel to Bulgaria
and Russia, also Slavonic powers created by foreign
princes.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Great-Moravia.
884.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The next considerable power which arose
nearly on the same ground was the Great Moravian
kingdom of Sviatopluk, which passed away before the
advance of the Magyars. Before its fall the Russian
power had already begun to form itself far to the
north-east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Four
Slavonic
groups.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Looking at the map just before the beginning
of the momentary Moravian and the lasting
Russian power, the North-Slavonic nations fall into four
main historical groups.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>North-western
group;
thoroughly
Germanized.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
There are, first, the tribes to
the north-west, whose lands, answering roughly to the
modern Mecklenburg, Pomerania, Brandenburg, and
Saxony, have been thoroughly Germanized.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>South-western
group under
German
supremacy<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Secondly,
there are the tribes to the south-west in <i>Bohemia</i>,
<i>Moravia</i>, and <i>Lusatia</i>, which were brought under
German dominion or supremacy, but from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">{474}</a></span>
Slavonic nationality has not in the same sort passed
away. <i>Silesia</i>, connected in different ways with both
these groups, forms the link between them and the third
group.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Central
group;
Polish.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This is formed by the central tribes of the whole
region, lying between the Magyar to the south and the
Prussian to the north, whose union made up the
original Polish kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eastern
group;
Russian.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Lastly, to the east lie the
tribes which joined to form the original Russian state.
Looking at these groups in our own time, we may
say that from the first of them all signs of Slavonic
nationality have passed away. The second and third,
speaking roughly, keep nationality without political
independence. The fourth group has grown into the
one great modern power whose ruling nationality is
Slavonic.</p>



<p class="p2">With regard to the first group, we have now to
trace from the Slavonic side the same changes of frontier
which we have already slightly glanced at from the
German side.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Polabic
group.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the land between the Elbe and the
Oder, taking the upper course of those rivers as represented
by their tributaries the Saale and the Bober,
we find that division of the Slaves which their own
historian marks off as <i>Polabic</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> These again fall
under three groups.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sorabi.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
First, to the south, in the modern
Saxony, are the <i>Sorabi</i>, the northern Serbs, cut off
for ever from their southern brethren by the Magyar
inroad.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Leuticii.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the north of them lie the <i>Leuticii</i>, <i>Weleti</i>,
<i>Weletabi</i>, or <i>Wiltsi</i>, and other tribes stretching to the
Baltic in modern Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Obotrites:<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In the north-west corner, in Mecklenburg and eastern
Holstein, were the <i>Obotrites</i>, <i>Wagri</i>, and other tribes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">{475}</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>their relations
to the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Through the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries the
relations between these lands and the Western Empire
was not unlike the relation of the southern Slaves
to the Eastern Empire during the same ages. Only
the Western Emperors never had such a rival on
their immediate border as the Bulgaria of Simeon
or Samuel.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations
of
tribute and
independence.
921-968.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Slavonic tribes on the north-eastern
border of the Western Empire were tributary or independent,
according as the Empire was strong or
weak. Tributary under Charles the Great, tributary
again under the great Saxon kings, they had an intermediate
period of independence. The German dominion,
which fell back in the latter part of the tenth
century, was again asserted by the Saxon dukes and
margraves in the eleventh and twelfth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Final
conquest.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Long before
the end of the twelfth century the work was done.

Large parts of the old Polish lands have passed under

But Poland, as a whole, has never been either
Germanized or brought under lasting German rule.
Holding the most central position of any European

East

as far as the upper course of the Oka. Cut off from
the Baltic by the Fins and Letts, they were cut off from
the Euxine by various Turanian races in turn, first
Magyars, then Patzinaks. To the south-east, from the
Dnieper to the Caspian, lay the <i>Chazar</i> dominion, to
which the Slaves east of Dnieper were tributary. To
the north-east lay a crowd of Finnish tribes, among
which is only one Finnish power of historic name, the

<p>The oldest Russia was thus, like the oldest Poland,

lands which afterwards passed under the rule of Poland
and Lithuania. <i>Little Russia</i>, <i>Black Russia</i>, <i>White
Russia</i>, <i>Red Russia</i>, all came under foreign rule. The
Dnieper, from which Russia was afterwards cut off,
was the great central river of the elder Russia; of the
Don and the Volga she held only the upper course. The
northern frontier barely passed the great lakes of Ladoga
and Onega, and the Gulf of Finland itself. It seems not
to have reached what was to be the Gulf of Riga, but
some of the Russian princes held a certain supremacy

power, German or Scandinavian, had any lasting hold
on any part of the eastern coast of the Baltic or its gulfs,
nor had any such power made any great advances on the
southern coast. Early in the fourteenth century the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">{486}</a></span>
whole of these coasts had been brought into different
degrees of submission to several Teutonic powers,
German and Scandinavian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German
influence
stronger
than
Scandinavian.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of the two influences the
German has been the more abiding. Scandinavian dominion
has now wholly passed away from these coasts,
and it is only in the lands north of the Finnish Gulf
that it can be said to have ever been really lasting.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
German
dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But German influence has destroyed, assimilated, or
brought to submission, the whole of the earlier inhabitants,
from Wagria to Esthland. In our own day
the whole coast, from the isle of Rügen to the head of
the gulf of Bothnia, is in the possession of two powers,
one German, one Slavonic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German

But German influence
abides beyond the bounds of German rule. Not only
have Pomerania and Prussia become German in every
sense, but Curland, Livland, and Esthland, under the
dominion of Russia, are still spoken of as German
provinces.</p>

<p class="pb2">This great change was brought about by a singular
union of mercantile, missionary, and military enterprise.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning
of Swedish
conquest in
Finland.
1155.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The beginning came from Scandinavia, when the
Swedish King Saint Eric undertook the conquest and
conversion of the proper Finland, east of the Gulf of
Bothnia. Here, in the space of about a century, a
great province was added to the Swedish kingdom, a
province whose eastern boundary greatly shifted, but
the greater part of which remained Swedish down to
the present century. To the south of the Gulf of Finland
the changes of possession have been endless. The
settled dominion of Sweden in those lands comes later;
Danish occupation, though longer, was only temporary.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German

Soon after the beginning of Swedish conquest in Finland
began the work of German mercantile enterprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">{487}</a></span>
followed fifty years later by German conquest and
conversion, in Livland and the neighbouring lands.
This hindered the growth of any native power on those
coasts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its effect on
Lithuania
and Russia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Even Lithuania in the days of its greatness was
cut off from the sea. Whatever tendencies towards
Russian supremacy had arisen in those parts were hindered
from growing into Russian dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Military
Orders.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Knights
of the Sword in Livland were followed by the Teutonic
Knights in Prussia, and the two orders became one.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Danish

Further west, the latter part of the twelfth and the beginning
of the thirteenth century saw a great, but mostly
short-lived, extension of Danish power over both German
and Slavonic lands.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Scandinavian

While the coasts are thus changing
hands, the relations of Scandinavian kingdoms to one
another are ever shifting.

And, alongside of princes and sovereign orders, this
time is marked by the appearance of the first germs
of the great German commercial league, which, without
becoming a strictly territorial power, exercised the
greatest influence on the disposal of power among all
its neighbours.</p>

fourteenth century of the Danish lands within the
northern peninsula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
Calmar.
1396.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the end of that century came
the union of Calmar, the principle of which was that
the three kingdoms, remaining separate states, should
be joined under a common sovereign. But this union
was never firmly established, and the arrangements of
the three crowns were shifting throughout the fifteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">{488}</a></span>

final breach of the union in the sixteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sweden

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of

The union of Iceland and Greenland with Norway

land, vanishes from history about the time of the
Calmar union. The Scandinavian settlements in and
about the British Islands all passed away.

The growth of Denmark at the other end

things looked as if Denmark was about to become the
chief power on all the Baltic coasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Holstein.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>South of the boundary stream of the Eider the

On the Baltic side lay the Slavonic land of <i>Wagria</i>,

In these lands began the eastern advance of
Denmark in the latter half of the twelfth century. All
Sclavinia was won, with at least a supremacy over the
Pomeranian land as far as the Riddow. Thus far the
Danish conquests, won mainly over Slaves, continue the
chain of occasional Scandinavian occupation on those
coasts, from the tenth century to the nineteenth. In
another point of view, the Christian advance, the overthrow
of the chief centre of Slavonic heathendom in
Rügen, carries on the work of the Saxon Dukes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Danish

But
in the first years of the next century began a Danish

Ditmarschen; and all these conquests were confirmed
by an Imperial grant.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>

the isle of Rügen and the neighbouring coast. This
remained Danish for a hundred years longer, nominally
for a hundred years longer still.</p>

<p class="pb2">The next changes tended to draw the lands immediately

with one another.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of

1232.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The southern part of the Danish
peninsula, from the Eider to the Aa, became a distinct fief
of the Danish crown, held by a Danish prince under the
name of the duchy of <i>South-Jutland</i>—<i>Jutia</i> or <i>Sunder-Jutia</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>United with

In the next century this duchy and the county

a promise that it should never be united with
the Danish crown.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duchy of

Henceforth South-Jutland begins
to be spoken of as the <i>duchy of Sleswick</i>. But of the
lands held together, Sleswick remained a fief of Denmark,
while Holstein remained a fief of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fluctuations

Yet Christian himself, already
king of the three kingdoms, was afterwards elected
Duke of Sleswick and Count of Holstein. The election

the other of the Danish crown, should never be separated.

In the same reign an Imperial grant raised the

its duke were not a continuous territory stretching from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">{491}</a></span>

<p>After the loss of Rügen, Denmark had little to do
with the Slavonic lands, except so far as the possession of
Holstein carried with it the possession of the old Slavonic
land of Wagria. Still the advance of Denmark
at the end of the twelfth century had a lasting effect
on the Slavonic lands by altogether shaking the Polish
dominion on the Baltic. But it shook it to the advantage,
not of Scandinavia, but of Germany. Between the
twelfth century and the fourteenth Poland lost all its
western dominions.
<i>Pomore</i>, <i>Pommern</i>, <i>Pomerania</i>, the
seaboard of the Lechish Slaves, is strictly the land between
the mouth of the Vistula and the mouth of the

But the eastern part of Pomerania,

remained under Polish superiority till the beginning
of the fourteenth century. Then the greater part
fell away, partly for ever, to the Pomeranian duchy
of <i>Wolgast</i>, partly, for a season only, to the Teutonic
Knights.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1220-1260.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the south <i>Barnim</i> and <i>Custrin</i> passed,
after some shiftings, to the mark of Brandenburg.

Further to the south, Silesia, divided among princes of
the house of Piast, gradually fell under Bohemian
supremacy. Thus the whole western part of the Polish
kingdom passed into the hands of princes of the Empire,
and was included within the bounds of the German
realm.</p>



<p class="p2">The fate of Silesia brings us again to the history of
the inland Slavonic land of the Czechs. <i>Bohemia</i> went
on, as duchy and kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> ruled by native princes
as vassals of the Empire. Moravia was a fief of
Bohemia. In the end Bohemia passed to German
kings, but not till it had become again the centre of
a dominion which recalls the fleeting powers of Samo
and Sviatopluk.

<p>The successors of Ottocar reigned only over
Bohemia and Moravia. Early in the next century the
Bohemian crown passed to the house of Luxemburg.
Under them Bohemia became a powerful state, but a state
becoming more and more German, less and less Slavonic.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Silesia,

The Bohemian possession of
the Upper Palatinate lies out of our Slavonic range.
Among the revolutions of the fifteenth century, we find
the Bohemian crown at one time held conjointly with
that of Hungary, at another time held by a Polish

But it was the fourfold dominion
of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Lusatia, which finally
passed to the House of Austria, to be shorn of its
northern and eastern lands to the profit, first of Saxony,
and then of Brandenburg or Prussia.</p>


<p class="p2">Thus far the Teutonic advance, both on the actual
Baltic coast and on the inland Slavonic region, had
been made to the profit, partly of the Scandinavian
kingdoms, partly of the princes of the Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>German
corporations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But
there were two other forms of Teutonic influence and
dominion, which fell to the share, not of princes, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">{494}</a></span>
corporate bodies, mercantile and military or religious.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Hansa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Hanseatic League was indeed a power in these
regions, but it hardly has a place on the map.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second

Even
before the second foundation of Lübeck by Henry the
Lion, German mercantile settlements had begun at
Novgorod, in Gotland, and in London.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent of
the League.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Gradually, in
the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
the League into which the union of the merchant
towns of Germany grew spread itself over the
Baltic, the Westfalian, and the Netherlandish lands.
A specially close tie bound together the five <i>Wendish</i>
towns, <i>Lübeck</i>, <i>Rostock</i>, <i>Wismar</i>, <i>Stralsund</i>, and
<i>Greifswald</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nature of
the union.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the union of a town with the
Hansa did not necessarily affect its political position.
It might, at least in the later stages of the
League, be a free city of the Empire, a town subject
to some prince of the Empire, or a town subject
to a prince beyond its bounds. Not only the Pomeranian
and Prussian cities under the rule of the Knights,
but Revel in Esthland under Danish rule formed part
of the League.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Hansa
not a
territorial
power.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The League waged wars, made peace,
overthrew and set up kings, as suited its interests; but
territorial dominion, strictly so called, was not its
object. Still in some cases privileges grew into something
like dominion; in others military occupation
might pass for temporary dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Hansa
in Gotland
and
Scania.<br />
1361.<br />
1368-1385.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus in the isle
of <i>Gotland</i> the Hansa had an ascendency which was
overthrown by the conquest of the island by the Danish
king Waldemar, a conquest avenged by a temporary
Hanseatic occupation of Scania. In fact the nature of
the League, the relations of the cities to one another,
geographical as well as political, hindered the Hansa
from ever becoming a territorial power like Switzerland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">{495}</a></span>
and the United Provinces. In the history of the Baltic
lands it takes for some ages a position at least equal
to that of any kingdom. But it is only casually and
occasionally that its triumphs can be marked on the
map.</p>


<p class="p2">The other great German corporation was not commercial,
but military and religious.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Swordbearers
and the
Teutonic
Order.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The conquests of
the Order of Christ and of the Order of Saint Mary—better
known as the <i>Sword-brothers</i> and the <i>Teutonic
Order</i>—were essentially territorial. These orders became
masters of a great part of the Baltic coast, and
wherever they spread their dominion, Christianity and
German national life were, by whatever means, established.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their
connexion
with the
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As both the chiefs of the Order and the
Livonian prelates ranked as princes of the Empire, the
conquests of the Knights were in some sort an extension
of the bounds of the Empire. Yet we can hardly look
on Livonia and Prussia as coming geographically
within the Empire in the same sense as Pomerania
and Silesia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
their rule.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But whether strictly an extension of the
Western Empire or not, the conquests of the Knights
were an extension of the Western Church, the Western
world, and the German nation, as against both heathendom
and Eastern Christianity, as against all the other
Baltic nationalities, non-Aryan and Aryan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Swordbearers

<p>The first settlement began in <i>Livland</i>. In the
beginning of the thirteenth century, the Knights of the
Order of Christ were called in as temporal helpers by
Bishop Albert of Riga, and they gradually won the
dominion of the lands on the gulf called from his city.

It was also the time when heathendom gave way to

At the beginning of the sixteenth century

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Revival of
Russia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the military orders had thus established
themselves on the Baltic coast, and had already largely
given way to the combined Polish and Lithuanian
power behind them, a new <i>Russia</i> was growing up
behind them all.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Power of
Moscow.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Cut off from all dealings with
Western Europe, save with its immediate western
neighbours, cut off from its own ecclesiastical centre
by the advance of Mussulman dominion, the new power
of <i>Moscow</i> was schooling itself to take in course of
time a greater place than had ever been held by the
elder power of Kief. The Mongol conquest had placed
the Russian principalities in much the same position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">{500}</a></span>
as that through which most of the south-eastern
lands passed before they were finally swallowed up
by the Ottoman.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The

The princes of Russia were dependent
on the Tartar dominion of <i>Kiptchak</i>, which
stretched from the Dniester north-eastwards over
boundless barbarian lands as far as the lower course of
the Jenisei. Its capital, the centre of the <i>Golden

Even Novgorod, under its great prince Alexander
Nevsky, did homage to the Khan. But this dependent
relation did not, like the Lithuanian conquests to
the west, affect the geographical frontiers of Russia.
The Russian centre at the time of the Mongol conquest
was the northern Vladimir.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Moscow

Towards the end of the

it became the centre of Russian life.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Name of
<i>Muscovy</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From <i>Moskva</i>
or <i>Moscow</i> comes the old name of <i>Muscovy</i>, a name
which historically describes the growth of the second
Russian power. Muscovy was to Russia what France
in the older sense was to the whole land which came
to bear that name. Moscow was to Russia all, and
more than all, that Paris was to France. It was to
Moscow as the centre that the separate Russian principalities
fell in; it was from Moscow as the centre that
the lost Russian lands were won back.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Other

states.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Besides Novgorod,
there still were the separate states of <i>Viatka</i>, <i>Pskof</i>,

late in the fifteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Decline of

But the Tartar power had
already begun to grow weaker before the end of the

the dissolution of the dominion of the older Khans.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Survey at

fifteenth
century.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus, at the end of the fifteenth century, five powers
held the Baltic coast. Sweden held the west coast
from the Danish frontier northward, with both sides
of the gulf of Bothnia and both sides of the gulf of
Finland. Denmark held the extreme western coast
and the isle of Gotland. Poland and Lithuania had a
small seaboard indeed compared to their inland extent.
Poland had only the Pomeranian and Prussian coast
which she had just won from the Knights. Lithuania
barely touched the sea between Prussia and Curland.
To the west of the Polish coast lay the now Germanized
lands of Pomerania and Mecklenburg. To the north-west
lay the coast of the German military Order, under
Polish vassalage in Prussia, independent in its northern
possessions. Thus almost the whole Baltic coast was
held by Teutonic powers; the Slavonic powers still
lie mainly inland. The Polish frontier towards the
Empire has been cut down to the limit which it kept
till the end. Pomerania, Silesia, a great part of the
mark of Brandenburg, have fallen away from the Polish
realm. On the other hand, that realm and its confederate
Lithuania have grown wonderfully to the east at the
cost of divided and dependent Russia, and have begun
to fall back again before Russia one and independent.
Bohemia, enlarged by Silesia and Lusatia, has entered so
thoroughly into the German world as almost to pass
out of our sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes of

<p>The work of the last four centuries on the Baltic
coast has been to drive back the Scandinavian power,
after a vast momentary advance, wholly to the west of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">{503}</a></span>
the Baltic—to give nearly the whole eastern coast to Russia—to
make the whole southern coast German. These
changes involve the wiping out, first of the German
military Order, and then of Poland and Lithuania.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of
Russia and
creation of
Prussia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This
last change involves the growth of Russia, and the creation
of Prussia in the modern sense, a sense so strangely
different from its earlier meaning. These two have been
the powers by which Sweden and Denmark have been
cut short, by which Poland and Lithuania have been
swallowed up. In this last work they indeed had a
third confederate. Still the share of Austria in the
overthrow of Poland was in a manner incidental. But
the existence of such a Polish and Lithuanian state
as stood at the end of the fifteenth, or even of the
seventeenth, century was inconsistent with the existence
of either Russia or Prussia as great European powers.</p>

<p>The period with which we have now to deal takes
in only the former stage of this process. Russia advances;
Prussia in the modern sense comes into being.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greatness

But Sweden is still the most advancing power of all;
and, if Denmark falls back, it is before the power of
Sweden. The Hansa too and the Knights pass away;
Sweden is the ruling power of the Baltic.</p>


<p class="p2">The sixteenth century saw the fall of both branches

century, must advance, unless it be artificially hindered;
and the new Russian state was driven to advance if it
was to exist at all. It had no sea-board, except on the
White Sea; it did not hold the mouth of any one of its
great rivers, except the Northern Dvina, a stream thoroughly
cut off from European life. The dominions of
Sweden, Lithuania, and the Knights cut Russia off from
the Baltic and from central Europe. To the south and
east she was cut off from the Euxine and the Caspian,
from the mouths of the Don and the Volga, by the
powers which represented her old barbarian masters.
Russia was thus not only driven to advance, but
driven to advance in various directions. She had to
win back her lost lands; she had, if she was really to
become an European power, to win her way to the
Baltic and to the Euxine.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance
to the
north-east.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Her position made it almost
equally needful to win her way to the Caspian, and
made it unavoidable that she should spread her power
over the barbarian lands to the north-east. Of these
several fields of advance the path to the Euxine was
the longest barred.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Order of

First, at the end of the fifteenth
century, began the recovery of the lost lands, a work
spread over the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
centuries. Then, in the sixteenth, came the eastern
extension at the cost of the now weakened Mongol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">{506}</a></span>

But, with this exception, Poland and Lithuania still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">{507}</a></span>
kept all the Russian lands south of Duna and west

The contrast between
the growth of Sweden and the contemporary growth
of Russia is instructive. The revived power of Moscow
was partly winning back its own lost lands, partly advancing
in directions which were needful for national
growth, almost for national being. The growth of
Sweden in so many directions was almost wholly a
growth beyond her own borders.

Hence doubtless it
came that the advance of Russia has been lasting, while
the advance of Sweden was only for a season. Sweden
has lost by far the greater part of her conquests; she
has kept only those parts of them which went to complete
her position in her own peninsula.</p>

<p>On the Swedish conquest of Esthland followed a

During the
reign of Gustavus Adolphus, and the period which we
might almost call the continuation of his reign after his
death, Sweden advanced both in her own peninsula and
east of the Baltic, while she also gained a wholly new
footing on German ground, both on the Baltic and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">{508}</a></span>

The Swedish frontier thus fixed took in all

<p>The Swedish acquisition of the eastern lands of
Denmark was made more necessary by the position
which Sweden had now taken on the central mainland.
The peace of Westfalia had confirmed her in the
possession of <i>Rügen</i> and <i>Western Pomerania</i> on the
Baltic, and of the bishoprics of <i>Bremen</i> and <i>Verden</i>
which made her a power on the Ocean. These lands
were not strictly an addition to the Swedish realm; they
were fiefs of the Empire held by the Swedish king. Here
again comes in the geographical law. The Swedish
possession of the German lands on the Ocean was short;
part of the German lands on the Baltic was kept into
the present century.</p>



<p class="p2">The peace of Roskild, which cut short the kingdoms
of Denmark and Norway in the northern peninsula, also
marks an epoch in the controverted history of the

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sweden
after the
peace of
Oliva.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The wars and treaties which were ended by the
peace of Oliva fixed the boundaries of the Baltic lands
for a season. They fixed the home extent of Sweden
down to the present century. They cut off Denmark,
save its one outpost of <i>Bornholm</i>, from the Baltic itself,
as distinguished from the narrow seas which lead to it.
They fixed the extent of Poland down to the partitions.
What they failed to do for any length of time was to
cut off Russia from the Baltic, and to establish Sweden
on the Ocean. But for the present we leave Sweden
ruling over the whole western and the greater part of
the eastern coast of the Northern Mediterranean, and
holding smaller possessions both on its southern coast
and on the Ocean. The rest of the eastern and southern
coast of the Baltic is divided between the Polish fief
of Curland, the dominions of the common ruler of Pomerania
and Prussia,—now an independent prince in
his eastern duchy,—and the small piece of Polish
coast placed invitingly between the two parts of
his dominions. In her own peninsula Sweden has
reached her natural frontier, and has given back what
she won for a moment beyond it. While Sweden has
this vast extent of coast with comparatively little
extent inland, the vast inland region of Poland and
Lithuania has hardly any seaboard, and the still vaster
inland region of Russia has none at all in Europe, except
on the White Sea. Thus the most striking feature of
this period is the advance of Sweden; but we have
seen that it was also a time of great advance on the
part of Russia. It was a time of yet greater advance
on that side of her dominion where Russia had no
European rivals.</p>

necessary to her existence. No hard line can be drawn
between her earliest and her latest conquests, between
the first advance of Novgorod and the last conquests in
Turkestan. But the advance which immediately followed
the deliverance from the Tartar yoke marks a great epoch.
The smaller khanats into which the dominion of the
Golden Horde had been broken up still kept Russia

<p>In the last section we traced out the greatest
advance of Sweden and a large advance of Russia, both
made at the cost of Poland, that of Sweden also at the

A little later the ruler of Russia, already

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Russia on

<p>But more pressing than the recovery of these lands
was the breaking down of the barrier by which Sweden
kept Russia away from the Baltic. To a very slight
extent this was a recovery of old Russian territory;
but the position now won by Russia was wholly new.

partly lost, to the profit of Brandenburg. The frontier

beyond the sea, though only beyond the inland

<p>Thus, by the end of the eighteenth century, the
Swedish power has fallen back. Its territory east of
the Baltic is less than it was at the beginning of the
sixteenth century. Denmark, on the other hand, has
grown by an advance in the debateable southern
duchies. All Sleswick is added to the Danish crown;
all Holstein is held by the Danish king. Poland has
vanished. The anomalous power on the middle
Danube, whose princes, it must be remembered, still
wore the crown of the Empire, has thrust itself into the
very heart of the old Polish land. But the power
which has gained most by the extinction of Poland has
been the new kingdom of Prussia. If part of her annexations
lasted only a few years, she made her Baltic
coast continuous for ever. But Prussia and Austria
alike, by joining to wipe out the central state of the
whole region, have given themselves a mighty neighbour.
Russia has wholly cast aside her character as a
mere inland power, intermediate between Europe and
Asia. She has won her way, after so many ages, to
her old position and much more. She has a Baltic and
an Euxine seaboard. Her recovery of her old lands
on the Duna and the Dnieper, her conquest of new
lands on the Niemen, have brought her into the heart
of Europe. And she has opened the path which was
also to lead her into the heart of Asia, and to establish
her in the intermediate mountain land between the
Euxine and the Caspian.</p>

wars till after the fall of the Western Empire.
At that moment the frontier of Germany and Denmark
was still what it had been under Charles the Great;
“Eidora Romani terminus Imperii.” Only now the
Danish king ruled to the south of the boundary stream
in the character of a prince of the Empire.

The fall
of the Empire put an end to this relation, and the
duchy of Holstein was incorporated with the Danish
realm. In the like sort, the Swedish kingdom was
extended to the central mainland of Europe, by the
incorporation of the Pomeranian dominions of the
Swedish king.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Russian
conquest of
Finland,
1809.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Before long, the last war between Sweden
and Russia was ended by the peace of Friderikshamn,
when Sweden gave up all her territory east of the
gulf as far as the river Tornea, together with the isles
of <i>Aland</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grand
Duchy of
Finland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These lands passed to the Russian Emperor
as a separate and privileged dominion, the <i>Grand Duchy
of Finland</i>. Thus Sweden withdrew to her own side
of the Baltic, while Russia at last became mistress of
the whole eastern coast from the Prussian border
northward.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
Sweden
and Norway.
1814-1815.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The general peace left this arrangement
untouched, but decreed the separation of Norway from
Denmark and its union with Sweden. This was carried
out so far as to effect the union of Sweden and Norway
as independent kingdoms under a single king.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Swedish

England. Thus the common king of Sweden and
Norway reigns over the whole of the northern peninsula

<p>In the lands which had been Poland and Lithuania,
the immediate result of the French wars was the

great extension of the dominion of Russia. Prussia had
to surrender its whole Polish territory, save West
Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>

Little Poland, Mazovia, and Lithuania. It took in the

Later events

Great Poland kept by Prussia and the part of Little
Poland kept by Austria, is merged in the Russian
Empire. Thus the Russian acquisition of strictly
Polish, as distinguished from old-Russian and Lithuanian
territory, dates, not from the partitions, but from
the Congress of Vienna. It was to the behoof of
Prussia and Austria, not of Russia, that the old
kingdom of the Piasts was broken in pieces.</p>

Meanwhile the Russian advance in the nineteenth

the lands on and beyond the Caspian has been far
greater than her advance during the eighteenth. It
is in our own century that Russia has taken up her
commanding position between the Euxine and the
Caspian seas, one which in some sort amounts to an enlargement
of Europe at the expense of Asia. The old
frontier on the Caspian, which had hardly changed
since the conquest of Astrakhan, reached to the <i>Terek</i>.

eighteenth century.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance in

The Persian and Turkish wars
gave Russia the Armenian land of <i>Erivan</i> as far as the

<p>Far again to the east, Russia has added a large
territory on the Chinese border on the river Amoor.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extent and
character
of the
Russian
dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All these conquests form the greatest continuous
extent of territory by land which the world has ever
seen, unless during the transient dominion of the old
Mongols. No other European power in any age has, or
could have had, such a continuous dominion, because
no other European power has ever had the unknown
barbarian world lying in the same way at its side. Nowhere
again has any European power held a dominion
so physically unbroken as that which stretches from
the gulf of Riga to the gulf of Okhotsk. The greater
part of the Asiatic dominion of Russia belongs to
that part of Asia which has least likeness to Europe.
It is only on the Frozen Ocean that we find a kind
of mockery of inland seas, islands, and peninsulas.
Massive unbroken extent by land is its leading character.
And as this character extends to a large part
of European Russia also, Russia is the only European
land where there can be any doubt where Europe
ends. The barbarian dominion of other European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">{523}</a></span>
states, a dominion beyond the sea, has been a dominion
of choice. The barbarian dominion of Russia in lands
adjoining her European territory is a dominion forced
on her by geographical necessity. The annexation of
Kamtschatka became a question of time when the first
successors of Ruric made their earliest advance towards
the Finnish north.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Russian
America.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">Alongside of this continuous dominion in Europe
and Asia, the Russian occupation of territory in a third
continent, an occupation made by sea after the manner
of other European powers, has not been lasting. The
Russian territory in the north-west corner of America,
the only part of the world where Russia and England
marched on one another, has been sold to the United
States.</p>



<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Final
Survey.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>To return to Europe, the events of the nineteenth
century have, in the lands with which we are dealing,
carried on the work of the eighteenth by the further
aggrandizement of Russia and Prussia. The Scandinavian
powers have withdrawn into the two Scandinavian
peninsulas and the adjoining islands, and in the
southern peninsula the power of Denmark has been
cut short to the gain of Prussia. The Prussian power
meanwhile, formed in the eighteenth century by the
union of the detached lands of Prussia and Brandenburg,
has in the nineteenth grown into the imperial
power of Germany, and has, even as a local kingdom,
become, by the acquisition of Swedish Pomerania,
Holstein, and Sleswick, the dominant power on the
southern Baltic. The acquisition of the duchies too, not
only of Sleswick and Holstein, but of Bremen and Verden
also, as parts of the annexed kingdom of Hannover, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">{524}</a></span>
given her a part of the former oceanic position both of
Denmark and Sweden. Russia has acquired the same
position on the gulfs of the Baltic which Prussia has on
the south coast of the Baltic itself. The acquisition of
the new Poland has brought her frontier into the very
midst of Europe; it has made her a neighbour, not
merely of Prussia as such, but of Germany. The third
sharer in the partition has drawn back from her
northern advance, but she has increased her scrap of
Russia, her scrap of Little Poland, her scrap of Moldavia,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
by the suppression of a free city. The southern
advance of Russia on European ground has been
during this century an advance less of territory than
of influence. The frontier of 1878 is the restored
frontier of 1812. It is in the lands out of Europe that
Russia has in the meanwhile advanced by strides which
look startling on the map, but which in truth spring
naturally from the geographical position of the one
modern European power which cannot help being
Asiatic as well.</p>

It was from the lands
which hindered both the West-Gothic and the Saracen
dominion from exactly answering to geographical Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">{527}</a></span>
that deliverance came, and it came in two forms.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The independent
lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
From
the land to the north-west, which held out against both
Goth and Saracen, came that form of deliverance which
was strictly native.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Frankish
dominion.
752-759.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
At the other end, the Frank first won
back for Christendom the Saracen province in Gaul, and
then carried his arms into the neighbouring corner of
Spain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>778.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus we get two centres of deliverance, two
groups of states which did the work. There are the north-western
lands, whose history is purely Spanish, which
simply withstood the Saracen, and the north-eastern
lands, which were first won from the Saracen by the
Frank, and which gradually freed themselves from their
deliverer.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Represented
severally
by
Castile and
Portugal,
and by
Aragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The former class are represented in later
Spanish history by the kingdoms of Castile and Portugal,
the latter by the kingdom of Aragon. Navarre lies
between the two, and shares in the history of both.
The former start geographically from the mountain
region washed by the Ocean. The latter start geographically
from the mountains which divide Gaul and
Spain, and which stretch westward to the Mediterranean.
The geographical position of the regions foreshadows
their later history.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Later history
of
Aragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was Aragon, looking
to the East, which first played a great part in European
affairs, and which carried Spanish influence and dominion
into Gaul, Sicily, Italy, and Greece.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Of Castile
and Portugal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was
Portugal and Castile, looking to the West, which
established an Iberian dominion beyond the bounds of
Europe. The fact that a Queen of Castile in the fifteenth
century married a King of Aragon and not a
King of Portugal has led us to speak of the peninsular
kingdoms as ‘<i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> For some ages
‘Spain and Aragon’ would have been a more natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">{528}</a></span>
division. But the very difference in the fields of action
of Castile and Aragon hindered any such strong opposition.
Between Castile and Portugal, on the other
hand, a marked rivalry arose in the field which was
common to both.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The more
strictly
native
centre
foremost in
the work of
deliverance.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Of these two centres, one purely Spanish, the other
brought for a long time under a greater or less degree
of foreign influence, the more strictly native region
was foremost in the work of national deliverance.
How far western Spain stood in advance of eastern
Spain is shown by the speaking fact that Toledo,
so much further to the south, was won by Castile
a generation before Zaragoza was won by Aragon.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Relations
of Castile
and Aragon
towards
Navarre.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But both Castile and Aragon, as powers, grew out
of the break-up of a momentary dominion in the
land which lay between them, and whose later history
is much less illustrious than theirs. In the second
quarter of the eleventh century the kingdom of
<i>Pampeluna</i> or <i>Navarre</i> had, by the energy of a single
man, the Sviatopluk or Stephen Dushan of his little
realm, risen to the first place among the Christian
powers of Spain. Castile and Aragon do not appear
with kingly rank till both had passed under the
momentary rule of a neighbour which in after times
seemed so small beside either of them. And the
name of <i>Castile</i>, whether as county, kingdom, or
empire, marks a comparatively late stage of Christian
advance. We must here go back for a moment to
those early days of the long crusade of eight hundred
years at which we have already slightly glanced.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>The Foundation of the Spanish Kingdoms.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Founding
of the
kingdom
of Leon.
753.<br />
916.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have seen how the union of the small independent
lands of the north, <i>Asturia</i> and <i>Cantabria</i>, grew
into the kingdom, first of <i>Oviedo</i> and then of <i>Leon</i>.
<i>Gallicia</i>, on the one side, representing in some sort the
old Suevian kingdom, <i>Bardulia</i> or the oldest <i>Castile</i>,
the land of Burgos, on the other side, were lands which
were early inclined to fall away.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Christian
advance.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The growth of the
Christian powers on this side was favoured by internal
events among the Mussulmans, by famines and revolts
which left a desert border between the hostile powers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Ommiad
emirate.
755.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Ommiad emirate, afterwards caliphate, was established
almost at the moment of the Saracen loss of
Septimania.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Spanish
March.
778-801.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then came the <i>Spanish March</i> of Charles
the Great, which brought part of northern Spain once
more within the bounds of the new Western Empire,
as the conquests of Justinian had brought back part
of southern Spain within the bounds of the undivided
Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its extent.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This march, at its greatest extent, took in
Pampeluna at one end and Barcelona at the other, with
the intermediate lands of <i>Aragon</i>, <i>Ripacurcia</i>, and
<i>Sobrarbe</i>. But the Frankish dominion soon passed
away from Aragon, and still sooner from Pampeluna.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its division.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The western part of the march, which still acknowledged
the superiority of the Kings of Karolingia, split
up into a number of practically independent counties,
which made hardly any advance against the common
enemy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the land of Pampeluna became, at the
beginning of the eleventh century, an independent and
powerful kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Navarre
under
Sancho the
Great.
1000-1035.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Navarre of Sancho the Great
stretched some way beyond the Ebro; to the west it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">{530}</a></span>
took in the ocean lands of <i>Biscay</i> and <i>Guipuzcoa</i>, with
the original Castile; to the east it took in <i>Aragon</i>,
<i>Ripacurcia</i>, and <i>Sobrarbe</i>. The two Christian kingdoms
of Navarre and Leon took in all north-eastern
Spain. The Douro was reached and crossed; the Tagus
itself was not far from the Christian boundary; but
the states which owned the superiority of the power
which we may now call <i>France</i> were still far from the
lower Ebro.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Break-up
of the
kingdom of
Navarre
(1035), and
of the
Ommiad
caliphate
(1028).<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At the death of Sancho the Great his momentary
dominion broke up. Seven years earlier the dominion
of the Ommiad caliphs had broken up also. These two
events, so near together, form the turning-point in the
history of the peninsula. Instead of the one Ommiad
caliphate, there arose a crowd of separate Mussulman
kingdoms, which had to call for help to their Mussulman
brethren in Africa.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Invasion
of the
Almoravides.
1086-1110.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This led to what was really
a new African conquest of Mussulman Spain. The
new deliverers or conquerors spread their dominion
over all the Mussulman powers, save only Zaragoza.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
name
<i>Moors</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This settlement, with other later ones of the same kind,
gives a specially African look to the later history of
Mahometan Spain, and has doubtless helped to give
the Spanish Mussulmans the common name of <i>Moors</i>.
But their language and culture remained Arabic, and
the revolution caused by the African settlers among
the ruins of the Western caliphate was far from being
so great as the revolution caused by the Turkish
settlers among the ruins of the Eastern caliphate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>New kingdoms,

<p>Out of the break-up of the dominion of Sancho

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Decline of

<p>Navarre meanwhile, cut short by the advance of
Castile, shorn of its lands on the Ocean and beyond
the Ebro, lost all hope of any commanding position in
the peninsula.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1234.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Growth of

But the power of Aragon
grew, partly by conquests from the Mussulmans, partly
by union with the French fiefs to the east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union with
Barcelona.
1131.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first
union between the crown of Aragon and the county

Aragon on both sides of the Pyrenees and even beyond
the Rhone.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1213.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlement

But by the final arrangement
which freed <i>Barcelona</i>, <i>Roussillon</i>, and <i>Cerdagne</i>,
from all homage to France, all trace of foreign
superiority passed away from Christian Spain. The
independent kingdom of Aragon stretched on both
sides of the Pyrenees, a faint reminder of the days of
the West-Gothic kings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">{532}</a></span></p>
<p>On the other side of the peninsula the lands
between Douro and Minho began to form a separate
state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>County of
Portugal.
1094.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The county of <i>Portugal</i> was held by
princes of the royal house of France, as a fief of the
crown of Castile and Leon.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom,
1139.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The county became a
kingdom, and its growth cut off Leon, as distinguished
from Castile, from any advance against the Mussulmans.
Navarre was cut off already. But the three
kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal were all
ready for the work. A restored Western Christendom
was growing up to balance the falling away in the
East.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beginning
of the great
Christian
advance.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The first great advance of the Christians in
Spain began about the time of the Seljuk conquests
from the Eastern Empire. The work of deliverance
was not ended till the Ottoman had been for forty
years established in the New Rome.</p>


<p class="p2">The Christian powers however were disunited,
while the Mussulmans had again gained, though at a
heavy price, the advantage of union.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest
of Toledo.
1085.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Alfonso the

The
Almoravide power was too strong for any present hope

but the one independent
Mussulman state at <i>Zaragoza</i> lay open to the
Christians of the north-east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance of
Castile.

Castile meanwhile pressed to the Guadiana
and beyond, counting <i>Calatrava</i> and <i>Badajoz</i> among
its cities. The line of struggle had advanced in about
a century from the land between Douro and Tagus to
the land between Guadiana and Guadalquivir.</p>

<p>This second great Christian advance in the twelfth,
century was again checked in the same way in which
the advance in the eleventh century had been.

Their

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Geographical
position
of the four
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus, in the latter part of the thirteenth century,
the peninsula of Spain was very unequally divided
between one Mussulman and four Christian states.
Aragon on the one side, Portugal on the other, were
kingdoms with a coast line out of all proportion to
their extent inwards. Aragon had become a triangle,
Portugal a long parallelogram, cut off on each side
from the great trapezium formed by the whole peninsula.
Between these two lay the central power of
Castile, with Christian Navarre still separate at one
corner and Mussulman Granada still separate at another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">{535}</a></span>
Of these five kingdoms, Navarre and Aragon alone
marched to any considerable extent on any state beyond
the peninsula. Castile barely touched the Aquitanian
dominions of England, while Navarre and Aragon, both
stretching north of the Pyrenees, had together a considerable
frontier towards Aquitaine and France.
Navarre and Aragon again marched on one another,
while Portugal and Granada marched only on Castile,
the common neighbour of all. The destiny of all was
written on the map. Navarre at one end, Granada at
the other, were to be swallowed up by the great central
power. Aragon, after gaining a high European position,
was to be united with Castile under a single
sovereign. Portugal alone was to become distinctly a
rival of Castile, but wholly in lands beyond the bounds
of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Title of
‘King of
Spain.’<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Of the five Spanish powers Castile so far outtopped
the rest that its sovereign was often spoken of in other
lands as <i>King of Spain</i>. But Spain contained more
kingdoms than it contained kings.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The lesser
kingdoms.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Castile, Aragon, and
Portugal were all formed by a succession of unions and
conquests, each of which commonly gave their kings a
new title. The central power was still the power of
<i>Castile and Leon</i>, not of Castile only. <i>Leon</i> was made
up of the kingdoms of <i>Leon</i> and <i>Gallicia</i>. Castile took
in Castile proper or <i>Old Castile</i>, with the principality of
the <i>Asturias</i>, and the free lands of <i>Biscay</i>, <i>Guipuzcoa</i>,
and <i>Alava</i>. To the south it took in the kingdoms—each
marking a stage of advance—of <i>Toledo</i> or <i>New
Castile</i>, of <i>Cordova</i>, <i>Jaen</i>, <i>Seville</i>, and <i>Murcia</i>. The
sovereign of Portugal held his two kingdoms of <i>Portugal</i>
and <i>Algarve</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1262.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The sovereign of Aragon, besides his
enlarged kingdom of <i>Aragon</i> and his counties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">{536}</a></span>
<i>Catalonia</i>, <i>Roussillon</i>, and <i>Cerdagne</i>, held his kingdom
of <i>Valencia</i> on the mainland, while the Balearic
Isles formed the kingdom of <i>Majorca</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1349.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
This last, first
granted as a vassal kingdom to a branch of the royal
house, was afterwards incorporated with the Aragonese
state.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Growth and Partition of the Great Spanish Monarchy.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Little geographical
change
after the
thirteenth
century.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">After the thirteenth century the strictly geographical
changes within the Spanish peninsula were but few.
The boundaries of the kingdoms changed but little
towards one another, and not much towards France,
their only neighbour from the fifteenth century onwards.
But the five kingdoms were gradually grouped under
two kings, for a while under one only.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Territories
beyond the
peninsula.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The external
geography, so to speak, forms a longer story. We have
to trace out the acquisition of territory within Europe,
first by Aragon and then by Castile, and the acquisition
of territory out of Europe, first by Portugal and then by
Castile.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The great
Spanish
Monarchy.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The permanent union of the dominions of Castile
and Aragon, the temporary union of the dominions
of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal, formed that great
<i>Spanish Monarchy</i> which in the sixteenth century was
the wonder and terror of Europe, which lost important
possessions in the sixteenth and in the seventeenth

<p>The acquisition of territory beyond the peninsula

<h3>§ 3. <i>The Colonial Dominion of Spain and Portugal.</i></h3>

<p>The distinction between Spain and Portugal is most
strikingly marked in the dominion of the two powers
beyond the bounds of Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character
of the
Portuguese
dominion
out of
Europe.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Portugal led the way
among European states to conquest and colonization
out of Europe. She had a geographical and historical
call so to do. Her dominion out of Europe was not
indeed a matter of necessity like that of Russia, but it
stood on a different ground from that of England,
France, or Holland. It was not actually continuous
with her own European territory, but it began near to
it, and it was a natural consequence and extension of
her European advance. The Asiatic and American
dominion of Portugal grew out of her African dominion,
and her African dominion was the continuation of her
growth in her own peninsula.</p>

<p>When the Moor was driven out of Spain, it was
natural to follow him across the narrow seas into a
land which lay so near to Spain, and which in earlier
geography had passed as a Spanish land.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Portugal
fully
formed in
the thirteenth
century.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But as far as
Castile was concerned, the Moor was not driven out till
late in the fifteenth century; as far as Portugal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">{541}</a></span>
concerned, he was driven out in the thirteenth. Portugal
had then reached her full extent in the peninsula,
and she could no longer advance against the misbelievers
by land. One is tempted to wonder that her advance
beyond sea did not begin sooner.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Her
African
conquests,
1415-1471.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It came in the fifteenth
century, when fifty years of conquest gave to
Portugal her kingdom of <i>Algarve beyond the Sea</i>, an
African dominion older than the Castilian conquest of
Granada.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Algarves.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The king of <i>Portugal and the Algarves</i> thus
held the southern pillar of Hercules, while Castile held
the northern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loss of
African
dominion,
1578.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The greater part of this African kingdom
was lost after the fall of Sebastian.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ceuta
Spanish.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Ceuta</i> remained
a Spanish possession after the dominion of Portugal, so
that Spain now holds the southern pillar and England
the northern.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tangier
English,
1662-1683.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Tangier</i> too once passed from Portugal
to England as a marriage gift, and was presently forsaken
as useless.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance
in Africa
and the
islands.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But before the kingdom of Algarve beyond the sea
had passed away, its establishment had led to the discovery
of the whole coast of the African continent, and
to the growth of a vast Portuguese dominion in various
parts of the world.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Madeira,
1419.<br />
Azores and
Cape Verde
Islands.
1448-1454.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Madeira</i> was the first insular possession,
followed by the <i>Azores</i> and <i>Cape Verde Islands</i>.
Gradually, under the care of Don Henry, the Portuguese
power spread along the north-west coast of Africa.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cape of
Good Hope,
1497.<br />
Dominion
of Arabia
and India.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The work went on: Vasco de Gama made his great
discovery of the Cape of Good Hope; the road to India
was opened; dominion on the coasts of Arabia and
India, and even in the islands of the Indian Archipelago,
was added to dominion on the coast of Africa. This
dominion perished through the annexation of Portugal
by Spain. Since the restoration of Portuguese independence,
only fragments of this great African and Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">{542}</a></span>
dominion have been kept.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Modern
extent of
Portuguese
dominion
abroad.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But Portugal still holds the
Atlantic islands, various points and coasts in Africa,
and a small territory in India and the Eastern islands.</p>

<p>But Portuguese enterprise led also to a more lasting
work, to the creation of a new European nation
beyond the Ocean, the single European monarchy
which has taken root in the New World.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Discovery
of Brazil,
1500.<br />
1531.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Brazil</i> was
discovered by Portuguese sailors at the end of the
fifteenth century; it was settled as a Portuguese possession
early in the sixteenth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1624-1654.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
During the union of
Portugal with Spain the Dutch won for a while a large
part of the country, but the whole was won back
by independent Portugal. The peculiar position of
Portugal, ever threatened by a more powerful neighbour,
gave her great Transatlantic dominion a special
importance.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1807.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was looked to as possible place for
shelter, which it actually became during the French
invasion of Portugal.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kingdom
of Portugal
and Brazil,
1813.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Portuguese dominions took
the style of ‘the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil,
and Algarve.’ Nine years later these kingdoms were
separated, and Brazil became an independent state.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Empire
of Brazil,
1822.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But it remains a monarchy with the title of Empire,
and it is still ruled by the direct representative of the
Portuguese royal house, while Portugal itself has passed
away from the native line by the accidents of female
succession.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century Brazil held a wholly
exceptional position. It was the only settlement of
Portugal, it was the only considerable settlement of
any European power, in a region which Spain claimed
as her exclusive dominion.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Division of
the Indies
between
Spain and
Portugal.
1494.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By Papal authority Spain
was to have all the newly found lands that lay to the
west, and Portugal all that lay to the east, of a line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">{543}</a></span>
on the map, drawn at 370 leagues west of the Cape
Verde Islands. Spain thus held the whole South
American continent, with the exception of Brazil, together
with that part of the North American continent
which is most closely connected with the southern.
While the non-European dominion of Portugal was
primarily African and Indian, the non-European dominion
of Spain was primarily American. It did not
in the same way spring out of the European history of
the country; it was rather suggested by rivalry of
Portugal.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Oran,
1516-1708.
1732-1791.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Africa the Spanish dominion hardly went
beyond the possession of <i>Oran</i> and the more lasting possession
of <i>Ceuta</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tunis,
1531.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The conquest of <i>Tunis</i> by Charles the
Fifth<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> was made rather in his Sicilian than in his Castilian
character. Within the range of Portuguese dominion
the settlements of Spain were exceptional. But they
took in the <i>Canaries</i> off the Atlantic coast of Africa,
and the <i>Philippine Islands</i> in the extreme eastern Archipelago.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insular
possessions
of Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These insular possessions Spain still keeps.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spanish
dominion
in America.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile the great Spanish dominion in the New
World, in both Americas and in the adjoining islands
of the West Indies, has risen and fallen.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Hispaniola,
1492.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It began with
the first conquest of Columbus, <i>Hispaniola</i> or Saint
<i>Domingo</i>. Thus the dominion of Castile beyond the
Ocean began at the very moment when she reached
the full extent of her own Mediterranean coast.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1519.<br />
1532.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then
followed the great continental dominion in <i>Mexico</i>,
<i>Peru</i>, and the other lands on or south of the isthmus
which joins the two western continents. But into the
body of the North American continent, the land which
was to be disputed between France and England, Spain
never spread. <i>New Mexico</i>, <i>California</i>, <i>Florida</i>, barely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">{544}</a></span>
stretched along its western and southern coasts.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Revolutions
of the
Spanish
colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
whole of this continental dominion passed away in a
series of revolutions within our own century. While
Portugal and England have really founded new
European nations beyond the Ocean, the result of
Spanish rule in America has been to create a number
of states of ever shifting extent and constitution, keeping
the Spanish language, but some of which are as
much native American as Spanish.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mexico.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of these <i>Mexico</i>
is the one which has had most to do with the general
history of Europe and European America.

under a foreign, adventurer. And vast provinces, once
under its nominal rule, have passed to the United
States.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cessions to
the United
States.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The loss of <i>Texas</i>, <i>New Mexico</i>, and <i>Upper

the extent of the first Spanish conquests.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Spanish

islands.<br />
Jamaica,
1655.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Of the Spanish West India islands, some, like
<i>Jamaica</i> and <i>Trinidad</i>, have passed to other European
powers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Saint
Domingo,
1864.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The allegiance of <i>Cuba</i> is
always doubtful. In short, the dominion of Spain out

Spain. The eighteenth century destroyed the one;
the nineteenth century has cut down the other to
mere fragments.</p>

We end by
leaving the mainland of Europe, by leaving the world of
either Empire, for that great island, or rather group of
islands, which for ages was looked on as forming a world
of its own.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Late Roman
conquest
and
early loss
of Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Western Europe Britain was the last land
to be won, and the first to be lost, in the days of the
elder Empire. And, after all, Britain itself was only
partly won, while the conquest of Ireland was never
tried at all.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Independence
of
Britain in
the later
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
After the English Conquest, Britain had
less to do with the revived Western Empire than any
Western land except Norway. The momentary dealings
of Charles the Great with Scotland and Northumberland,
the doubtful and precarious homage done by
Richard the First to Henry the Sixth, are the only exceptions,
even in form, to its complete independence
on the continental Empire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Britain
another
world and
another
Empire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The doctrine was that
Britain, the other world, formed an Empire of its own.
That Empire, being an island, was secured against the
constant fluctuations of its external boundary to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">{546}</a></span>
continental states lie open.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Changes
within
Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
For several centuries the
boundaries, both of the Celtic and Teutonic occupants
and of the Teutonic kingdoms among themselves, were
always changing. But these changes hardly affect
European history, which is concerned only with the
broad general results—with the establishment of the
Teutonic settlers in the island—with the union of those
settlers in one kingdom under the West-Saxon house—with
the extension of the imperial power of the West-Saxon
kings over the whole island of Britain.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Slight
change in
the internal
divisions of
England.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
And,
from the eleventh century onwards, there has been
singularly little change of boundaries within the island.
The boundaries of England towards Scotland and Wales
changed much less than might have been looked for
during ages of such endless warfare. Even the lesser
divisions within the English kingdom have been singularly
lasting. The land, as a whole, has never been
mapped out afresh since the tenth century. While a map
of France or Germany in the eleventh century, or even in
the eighteenth, is useless for immediate practical objects,
a map of England in the days of Domesday practically
differs not at all from a map of England now. The
only changes of any moment, and they are neither
many nor great, are in the shires on the Welsh and
Scottish borders.</p>

<p>Thus the historical geography of the isle of Britain
comes to little more than a record of these border
changes, down to the incorporation of England, Scotland,
and Wales into a single kingdom. In the other
great island of Ireland there is little to do except
to trace how the boundary of English conquest advanced
and fell back, a matter after all of no great
European concern. The history of the smaller outlying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">{547}</a></span>
islands, from Scandinavian Shetland to the insular
Normandy, has really more to do with the general
history of Europe. The dominion of the English kings
on the continent is of the highest European moment,
but, from its geographical side, it is Gaul and not
Britain which it affects.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>English
settlements
beyond sea.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The really great geographical
phænomenon of English history is that which
it shares with Spain and Portugal, and in which it
surpasses both. This is the vast extent of outlying
English dominion and settlement, partly in Europe, but
far more largely in the distant lands of Asia, Africa,
America, and Australia. But it is not merely that
England has become a great power in all quarters of
the world; England has been, like Portugal, but on a far
greater scale, a planter of nations.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>English
nations.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
One group of her
settlements has grown into one of the great powers of
the world, into a third England beyond the Ocean,
as far surpassing our insular England in geographical
extent as our insular England surpasses the first England
of all in the marchland of Germany and Denmark.
The mere barbaric dominion of England concerns
our present survey but little; but the historical
geography of Europe is deeply concerned in the
extension of England and of Europe in lands beyond
the Western and the Southern Ocean.</p>


<p class="p2">In tracing out the little that we have to say of the
geography of Britain itself, it will be well to begin
with that northern part of the island where changes
have been both more numerous and more important
than they have been in England.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>The Kingdom of Scotland.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Historical
position of
Scotland.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">In Northern Britain, as in some other parts of
Europe, we see a land which has taken its name from
a people to which it does not owe its historic importance.
<i>Scotland</i> has won for itself a position in Britain
and in Europe altogether out of proportion to its size
and population. But it has not done this by virtue of
its strictly Scottish element.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Greatness
of Scotland
due to its
English
element.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Irish settlers who
first brought the Scottish name into Britain<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> could
never have made Scotland what it really became. What
founded the greatness of the Scottish kingdom was the
fact that part of England gradually took the name of
Scotland and its inhabitants took the name of Scots.
The case is as when the Duke of Savoy and Genoa
and Prince of Piedmont took his highest title from that
Sardinian kingdom which was the least valuable part
of his dominions. It is as when the ruler of a mighty
German realm calls himself king of the small duchy of
Prussia and its extinct people.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Two
English
kingdoms
in Britain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The truth is that, for
more than five hundred years, there were two English
kingdoms in Britain, each of which had a troublesome
Celtic background which formed its chief difficulty.
One English king reigned at Winchester or London,
and had his difficulties in Wales and afterwards in
Ireland. Another English king reigned at Dunfermline
or Stirling, and had his difficulties in the true
Scotland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extension
of the Scottish
name.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the southern kingdom, ruled by kings
of native English or of foreign descent, but never by
kings of British or Irish descent,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> always kept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">{549}</a></span>
English name, while the northern kingdom, ruled by
kings of Scottish descent, adopted the Scottish name.
The English subjects of the King of Scots gradually
took the Scottish name to themselves.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Analogy of
Switzerland.<br />
Threefold
elements in
the later
Scotland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
As the present
Swiss nation is made up of parts of the German, Burgundian,
and Italian nations which have detached
themselves from their several main bodies, so the
present Scottish nation is made up of parts of the
English, Irish, and British nations which have detached
themselves from their several main bodies. But in
both cases it is the Teutonic element which forms the
life and strength of the nation, the kernel to which the
other elements have attached themselves.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>True position
of the
Kings of
Scots.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
We cannot
read the mediæval history of Britain aright, unless we
remember that the King of Scots was in truth the
English king of Teutonic Lothian and Teutonized
Fife.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Enmity of
the true
Scots.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The people from whom he took his title were at
most his unwilling subjects; they were often his open
enemies, the allies of his southern rival.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lothian,
Strathclyde,
and
Scotland.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The modern kingdom of Scotland was made up of
English <i>Lothian</i>, British <i>Strathclyde</i>, and Irish <i>Scotland</i>.
The oldest Scotland is Ireland, whence the Scottish
name, long since forgotten in Ireland itself, came into
Britain and there spread itself. These three elements
stand out plainly.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Picts.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the Scottish or Irish element
swallowed up another, that of the <i>Picts</i>, of whom there
can be no doubt that they were Celts, like the Scots
and Britons, but about whom it may be doubted
whether their kindred was nearer to the Scots or to
the Britons. For our purpose the question is of little
moment. The Picts, as far as geography is concerned,
either vanished or became Scots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">{550}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of
the Picts
and Scots
in the ninth
century.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Early in the ninth century the land north of the
firths of Clyde and Forth was still mainly Pictish. The
second Scotland (the first Scotland in Britain) had not
spread far beyond the original Irish settlement in the
south-west.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of

Scots,

The Celtic
Scotland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The union of Picts and Scots under a
Scottish dynasty created the larger Scotland, the true
Celtic Scotland, taking in all the land north of the
firths, except where Scandinavian settlers occupied the
extreme north.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bernicia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
South of the firths, English <i>Bernicia</i>,
sometimes a separate kingdom, sometimes part of <i>Northumberland</i>,
stretched to the firth of Forth, with <i>Edinburgh</i>
as a border fortress.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Strathclyde
or
Cumberland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the west of Bernicia,
south and east of the firth of Clyde, lay the British kingdom
of <i>Cumberland</i> or <i>Strathclyde</i>, with <i>Alcluyd</i> or
<i>Dumbarton</i> as its border fortress.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Galloway.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the south-west
again lay the outlying Pictish land of <i>Galloway</i>, which
long kept up a separate being. Parts of Bernicia, parts
of Strathclyde, were one day to join with the true
Scotland to make up the later Scottish kingdom. As
yet the true Scotland was a foreign and hostile land
alike to Bernicia and to Strathclyde.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlements
of
the Northmen.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the next century we see the Scottish power cut
short to the north and west, but advancing towards the
south and east.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Caithness.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The Northmen have settled in the
northern and western islands, in those parts of the
mainland to which they gave the names of <i>Caithness</i>
and <i>Sutherland</i>, and even in the first Scottish land in
the west.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Scotland

On the other

England.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cession of
Lothian,

Later in the same century or early in the
next, the Kings of Scots received Northern Bernicia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">{551}</a></span>
the land of <i>Lothian</i>, as an English earldom. On the
other side, <i>Strathclyde</i> or <i>Cumberland</i>—its southern
boundary is very uncertain—had become in a manner
united to England and Scotland at once.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Grant of
Cumberland,
945.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
An English
conquest, it was granted in fief to the King of Scots,
and was commonly held as an appanage by Scottish
princes.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Different
tenures of
the dominion
of
the King
of Scots.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Thus the King of Scots held three dominions
on three different tenures. Scotland was a kingdom
under a merely external English supremacy; Cumberland
was a territorial fief of England; Lothian was an
earldom within the English kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The distinctions
forgotten in
later controversies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In after times
these distinctions were forgotten, and the question now
was whether the dominions of the King of Scots, as a
whole, were or were not a fief of England. When the
question took this shape, the English king claimed more
than his ancient rights over Scotland, less than his
ancient rights over Lothian.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Effects of
the grant
of Lothian.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The acquisition of Lothian made the Scottish
kingdom English. Lothian remained English; Cumberland
and the eastern side of Scotland itself, the
Lowlands north of the firth of Forth, became practically
English also. The Scottish kings became English
princes, whose strength lay in the English part of their
dominions.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fate of
southern
Cumberland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But late in the eleventh century it would
seem that the southern part of Cumberland had
become a separate principality ruled by a refugee
Northumbrian prince under Scottish supremacy.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Carlisle
and its district

to England

Rufus,

This
territory, the city of <i>Carlisle</i> and its immediate district,
the old diocese of Carlisle, was added to England
by William Rufus.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cumberland
and
Northumberland

On the other hand, in the troubles

English earldoms, Cumberland—in a somewhat wider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">{552}</a></span>
sense—and <i>Northumberland</i> in the modern sense, the
land from the Tweed to the Tyne. Had these earldoms
been kept by the Scottish kings, they would doubtless
have become Scottish lands in the same sense in
which Lothian did; that is, they would have become
parts of the northern English kingdom.

Scotland in the modern
sense—that is, Scotland in the older sense, Lothian,
and Strathclyde—was for a moment held strictly as a
fief of England.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1296.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was then for another moment

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1327.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It was then acknowledged
as an independent kingdom.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1333.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It again fell under
vassalage for a moment, and again won its independence.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1603.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Then, at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, England and Scotland, as distinct, independent,
and equal kingdoms, passed under a common king.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1649.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
They were separated again for a moment when Scotland
acknowledged a king whom England rejected.

they took in <i>Moray</i> at one end and <i>Galloway</i> at the

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Harold’s

Wales,
1063.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The changes of boundary between England and

with the great Welsh campaign of Harold.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Enlargement
of the
border
shires.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All the
border shires, Cheshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire,
Gloucestershire, seem now to have been enlarged; the
English border stretched to the <i>Conway</i> in the north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">{554}</a></span>
and to the <i>Usk</i> in the south.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Marches.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But part of this territory
seems to have been recovered by the Welsh princes,
while part passed into the great <i>march</i> district of England
and Wales, ruled by the Lords Marchers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
South
Wales,
1070-1121.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The gradual
conquest of South Wales began under the Conqueror
and went on under his sons; but it was more largely
the work of private adventurers than of the kings
themselves. The lands of <i>Morganwg</i>, <i>Dyfed</i>, <i>Ceredigion</i>,
and <i>Breheiniog</i>, answering nearly to the modern
South Wales, were gradually subdued.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Flemish

In some districts,

Meanwhile in North Wales native princes—<i>Princes

by Edward the First.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cessions to
England,

Wales,

Six years later followed
the complete conquest. But complete incorporation
with England did not at once follow.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Principality
of
Wales.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Wales, North
and South, remained a separate dominion, giving the
princely title to the eldest son of the English king.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
Some shires were formed; some new towns were
founded; the border districts remained under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">{555}</a></span>
anomalous jurisdiction of the Marchers.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Full incorporation.
1535.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The full incorporation
of the principality and its marches dates
from Henry the Eighth. Thirteen new counties were
formed, and some districts were added or restored to
the border shires of England. One of the new counties,
<i>Monmouthshire</i>, was, under Charles the Second,
added to an English circuit, and it has since been
reckoned as an English county.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Domesday
shires.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Setting aside these new creations, all the existing
shires of England were in being at the time of the
Norman Conquest, save those of <i>Lancaster</i>, <i>Cumberland</i>,
<i>Westmoreland</i>, and <i>Rutland</i>. The boundaries were
not always exactly the same as at present; but the
differences are commonly slight and of mere local interest.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Two classes
of shires.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The shires, as they stood at the Conquest, were
of two classes.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ancient
kingdoms
and principalities.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Some were old kingdoms or principalities,
which still kept their names and boundaries as shires.
Such were the kingdoms of <i>Kent</i>, <i>Sussex</i>, and <i>Essex</i>, and
the East-Anglian, West-Saxon, and Northumbrian shires.
Most of these keep old local or tribal names; a few
only are called from a town.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mercian
shires
mapped out
in the
tenth century.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In Mercia on the other
hand, the shires seem to have been mapped out afresh
when the land was won back from the Danes. They
are called after towns, and the town which gives the
name commonly lies central to the district, and remains
the chief town of the shire, except when it has
been outstripped by some other in modern times.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Both classes of shires survived the Conquest, and both
have gone on till now with very slight changes.</p>

<p>On the Welsh border, all the shires, for reasons
already given, stretch further west in Domesday than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">{556}</a></span>
they do now.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cumberland
and
Westmoreland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
On the Scottish border <i>Cumberland</i> and
<i>Westmoreland</i> were made out of the Cumbrian conquest
of William Rufus, enlarged by districts which
in Domesday appear as part of Yorkshire.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lancashire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
<i>Lancashire</i>
was made up of lands taken from Yorkshire
and Cheshire, the Ribble forming the older boundary
of those shires. The older divisions are marked by the
boundaries of the dioceses of <i>York</i>, <i>Carlisle</i>, and <i>Lichfield</i>
or <i>Chester</i>, as they stood down to the changes
under Henry the Eighth.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rutland.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
In central England the only
change is the formation of the small shire of <i>Rutland</i>
out of the Domesday district of Rutland (which, oddly
enough, appears as an appendage to <i>Nottinghamshire</i>),
enlarged by a small part of what was then <i>Northamptonshire</i>.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Ireland.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ireland

<p>The second great island of the British group, <i>Ireland</i>,
the original <i>Scotia</i>, has had less to do with the general
history of the world than any other part of Western
Europe. Its ancient divisions have lived on from the
earliest times.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The five
provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The names of its five great provinces,
<i>Ulster</i>, <i>Meath</i>, <i>Leinster</i>, <i>Munster</i>, and <i>Connaught</i>, are all
in familiar use, though <i>Meath</i> has sunk from its old
rank alongside of the other four. The Celtic inhabitants
of the island remained independent of foreign
powers till the days of Scandinavian settlement. Just
like the English kingdoms in Britain, the great divisions
of Ireland were sometimes independent, sometimes
united under the supremacy of a head king.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Settlement
of the
Ostmen.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Gradually
the Northmen, called in Ireland <i>Ostmen</i>, settled on
the eastern coast, and held the chief ports, as <i>Dublin</i>,
<i>Waterford</i>, <i>Wexford</i>, two of which names bear witness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">{557}</a></span>
Teutonic occupation.

And, from the latter half of the tenth century onward,
the eastern coast of Ireland shows a growing connexion
with England. Any actual English supremacy seems
doubtful; but both commercial and ecclesiastical ties became
closer during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The

by Cromwell.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1171.<br />
Fluctuations
of
the Pale.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
All Ireland admitted for a moment the
supremacy of Henry; but, till the sixteenth century,

<p>In the early days of the conquest Ireland is spoken
of as a kingdom; but the title soon went out of use.
The original plan seems to have been that Ireland, like
Wales afterwards, should form an appanage for a son
of the English King. It became instead, so far as it
was an English possession at all, a simple dependency
of England, from which the King took the title of <i>Lord
of Ireland</i>.

This state of things was diversified

under James the Second.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1782-1800.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But for the last eighteen
years of the last century, Ireland was formally acknowledged
as an independent kingdom, connected with
Great Britain only by the tie of a common king.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1801.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Since
that time it has formed an integral part of the United

<h3>§ 4. <i>Outlying European Possessions of England.</i></h3>

<p>Ireland, the sister island of Britain, has thus been
united with Britain into a single kingdom. Man, lying
between the two, remains a distinct dependency.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Norman

This last is also still the position of that part of the
Norman duchy which clave to its own dukes, which
never became French, but always remained Norman.
It might be a question what was the exact position of
<i>Guernsey</i>, <i>Jersey</i>, <i>Alderney</i>, <i>Sark</i>, and their smaller
neighbours, when the English kings took the titles of the
French kingdom and actually held the Norman duchy.
Practically the islands have, during all changes, remained
attached to the English crown; but they have
never been incorporated with the kingdom.

Other

and <i>Calais</i>, as fixed by the Peace of Bretigny. Since
the loss of Aquitaine, England has had no considerable
continental dominion in Europe, but she has from time

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Outposts

Such
are <i>Calais</i>, <i>Boulogne</i>, <i>Dunkirk</i>, <i>Gibraltar</i>, <i>Minorca</i>,

in their natural geographical places. To these we may
add <i>Tangier</i>, which has more in common with the
possession of Gibraltar and Minorca than with the English
settlements in the further parts of Africa. Of these
points, Gibraltar, Heligoland, and Malta, are still held
by England.

<h3>§ 5. <i>The American Colonies of England.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonies of
England.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>England, like France and Holland, became a colonizing
power by choice. Extension over barbarian
lands was not a necessity, as in the case of Russia, nor
did it spring naturally out of earlier circumstances, as
in the case of Portugal. But the colonizing enterprise
of England has done a greater work than the colonizing
enterprise of any other European power. The
greatest colony of England—for in a worthier use of
language the word <i>colony</i> would imply independence
rather than dependence<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>—is that great Confederation
which is to us what Syracuse was to Corinth, what
Milêtos was to Athens, what Gades and Carthage were
to the cities of the older Canaan.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The United
States.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>United States
of America</i>, a vaster England beyond the Ocean, an
European power, on a level with the greatest European
powers, planted beyond the bounds of Europe,
form the great work of English and European enterprise
in non-European lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>First

America,

<p>The settlements which grew into the United States
were not the first English possessions in North America,
but they were the first which really deserved to be
called colonies. The first discoveries of all led only
to the establishment of the <i>Newfoundland</i> fisheries.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Attempts

In the seventeenth century began the planting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">{560}</a></span>
thirteen settlements which won their independence.
Of these the earliest and the latest, the most southern
and the most northern, began through English colonization
in the strictest sense.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Virginia,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The New

States,

Then
followed the Puritan colonization much further to the
north which founded the <i>New England</i> states. The
shiftings among these settlements, from <i>Plymouth</i> to
<i>Maine</i>, the unions, the divisions, the colonies of colonies—the
Epidamnos and the Sinôpê of the New World—the
various and varying relations between the different
settlements, read like a piece of old Greek or of Swiss
history.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1629-1692.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
By the end of the seventeenth century they
had arranged themselves into four separate colonies.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1820.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
These were <i>Massachusetts</i>, formed by the union of <i>Massachusetts</i>
and <i>Plymouth</i>, with its northern dependency
of <i>Maine</i>, which became a separate State long after the
Revolution; <i>New Hampshire</i>, annexed by Massachusetts
and after a while separated from it; <i>Connecticut</i>, formed
by the union of <i>Connecticut</i> and <i>Newhaven</i>; <i>Rhode Island</i>,
formed by the union of <i>Rhode Island</i> and <i>Providence</i>.
These New England States form a distinct geographical
group, with a marked political and religious character
of their own.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The
Southern
Colonies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Meanwhile, at some distance to the
south, around Virginia as their centre, grew up another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">{561}</a></span>
group of colonies, with a history and character in many
ways unlike those of New England.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Maryland.
1646.<br />
Carolina.
1650-1663.<br />
Divided,
1720.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the north
of Virginia arose the proprietary colony of <i>Maryland</i>;
to the south arose <i>Carolina</i>, afterwards divided into
<i>North and South</i>. South Carolina for a long while
marked the end of English settlement to the south, as
Maine did to the north.</p>

<p>But between these two groups of English colonies in
the strictest sense lay a region in which English settlement
had to take the form of conquest from another
European power. Earlier than any English settlement
except Virginia, the great colony of the United Provinces
had arisen on Long Island and the neighbouring mainland.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New

1614.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

capital of <i>New Amsterdam</i>.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New
Sweden,
1658.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
To the south, on the shores
of Delaware Bay, the other great power of the seventeenth
century founded the colony of <i>New Sweden</i>.
Three European nations, closely allied in race, speech,
and creed, were thus for a while established side by
side on the eastern coasts of America.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Union of
New Sweden
with
New
Netherlands,
1655.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But the three
settlements were fated to merge together, and that by
force of arms. A local war added New Sweden to New
Netherlands; a war between England and the United
Provinces gave New Netherlands to England.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>New York.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
New
Amsterdam became <i>New York</i>, and gave its name to
the colony which was to become the greatest State of
the Union.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>1674.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Ten years later, in the next war between
the two colonizing powers, the new English possession
was lost and won again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the gap which was still left began to be
filled up by other English settlements.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pennsylvania,

The great colony of <i>Pennsylvania</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">{562}</a></span>
next arose, from which the small one of <i>Delaware</i>
was parted off twenty years later. Pennsylvania was
thus the last of the original settlements of the seventeenth
century, which in the space of nearly eighty
years had been formed fast after one another.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Georgia,
1733.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Fifty
years after the work of the benevolent Penn came the
work of the no less benevolent Oglethorpe; <i>Georgia</i>,
to the south of all, now filled up the tale of the famous
Thirteen, the fitting number, it would seem, for a
Federal power, whether in the Old World or in the
New.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Independence
of
the United
States,
1783.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="pb2">By the Peace of Paris the Thirteen Colonies were
acknowledged as independent States. The great work
of English settlement on foreign soil was brought to
perfection. The new and free English land beyond the
Ocean took in the whole temperate region of the North
American coast, all between the peninsula of <i>Acadia</i> to
the north and the other peninsula of <i>Florida</i> to the south.
Both of these last lands were English possessions at the
time of the War of Independence, but neither of them
had any share in the work.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nova
Scotia,
1713.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Acadia, under the name of
<i>Nova Scotia</i>, had been ceded by France in the interval
between the settlement of Pennsylvania and the settlement
of Georgia.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conquest of
Canada,
1759-1763.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Next came the conquest of <i>Canada</i>,
in which the men of the colonies played their part.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French
barrier at
Alleghany.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Hitherto the English colonies had been shut in to the
West by the French claim to the line of the Alleghany
mountains. The Treaty of Paris took away this bugbear,
and left the whole land as far as the Mississippi
open to the enterprise of the English colonists. Thus,
when the Thirteen States started on their independent
career, the whole land between the great lakes, the
Ocean, and the Mississippi, was open to them.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Florida

indeed, first as an English, then again as a Spanish possession,
cut them off from the Gulf of Mexico. The
city of <i>New Orleans</i> remained, first a Spanish, then a
French, outpost east of the Mississippi, and the possessions
still held by England kept them from the mouth
of the Saint Lawrence.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Extension
to the
West.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But within these limits, such
of the old States as were allowed by their geographical
position might extend themselves to the west, and
new States might be formed. Both processes went on,
and two of the barriers formed by European powers
were removed.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Louisiana,
1803.<br />
Florida,
1821.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The purchase of <i>Louisiana</i> from France,
the acquisition of <i>Florida</i> from Spain, gave the States
the sea-board of the Gulf of Mexico, and allowed their
extension to the Pacific. The details of that extension,
partly by natural growth, partly at the expense of the
Spanish element in North America, it is hardly needful
to go through here.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>A new
English
nation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
But, out of the English settlements
on the North-American coast, a new English
nation has arisen, none the less English, in a true view
of history, because it no longer owes allegiance to the
crown of Great Britain. But the power thus formed,
exactly like earlier confederations in Europe, lacks a
name.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lack of a
name.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The <i>United States of America</i> is hardly a geographical
or a national name, any more than the names
of the <i>Confederates</i> and the <i>United Provinces</i>. In the two
European cases common usage gave the name of a single
member of the Union to the whole, and in the case of
Switzerland the popular name at last became the formal
name. In the American case, on the other hand,
popular usage speaks of the Confederation by the name
of the whole continent of which its territory forms part.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Use of the
word
<i>America</i>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
For several purposes, the words <i>America</i> and <i>American</i>
are always understood as shutting out Canada and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">{564}</a></span>
Mexico, to say nothing of the southern American continent.
For some other purposes, those names still take
in the whole American continent, north and south. But
it is easier to see the awkwardness of the usual nomenclature
than to suggest any improvement on it.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second

<p class="pb2">While one set of events in the eighteenth century
created an independent English nation on North
American soil, another set of events in the same century,
earlier in date but later in their results, has led

another English nation which still keeps its allegiance

<p class="pb2">In all these cases of real colonization, of real
extension of the English or any other European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">{567}</a></span>
nation, it is hardly a figure to say that the bounds of
Europe have been enlarged. All that makes Europe
Europe, all that parts off Europe from Africa and Asia,
has been carried into America and Australia and
Africa itself. The growth of this new Europe, no less
than the changes of the old, is an essential part of
European geography.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Barbarian
dominion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
It is otherwise with territories,
great or small, which have been occupied by England
and other European powers merely for military or
commercial purposes. Forts, factories, or empires, on
barbarian soil, where no new European nation is likely
ever to grow up, are not cases of true colonization;
they are no extension of the bounds of Europe.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>English
dominion
in India.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
The
climax of this kind of barbarian dominion is found in

Portugal, France, and the heirs of Timour.
<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Empire of
India.
1876.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>
Of that dominion the scientific frontier has yet to be
traced; yet it has come to give an Imperial title to the
sovereign of Great Britain and Ireland, while those two
European islands, as perhaps befits their inferiority in
physical size, remain content with the lowlier style of the
United Kingdom. Whether the loftier pretensions of Asia
do, or do not, imply any vassalage on the part of Europe,
it is certain that the Asiatic Empire of the sovereign of
the British kingdom is no extension of England, no
extension of Europe, no creation of a new English or
European nation. The Empire of India stands outside
the European world, outside the political system
which has gathered round the Old and the New Rome.
But a place amongst the foremost members of that
system belongs to the great European nation on
American soil, where the tongue of England is kept,
and the constitution of old Achaia is born again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">{568}</a></span>
in a confederation stretching from the Western to the
Eastern Ocean.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Summary.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>We have thus traced the geography, and in tracing
the geography we have in a slighter way traced the
history, of the various states and powers of Europe,
and of the lands beyond the Ocean which have been
planted from Europe. We have throughout kept
steadily before our eyes the centre, afterwards the
two centres, of European life. We have seen how the
older states of Europe gradually lose themselves in the
dominion of Rome, how the younger states gradually
spring out of the dominion of Rome. We have
followed, as our central subjects, the fates of those
powers in the East and West which continued the Roman
name and Roman traditions. We have traced out the
states which were directly formed by splitting off from
those powers, and the states which arose beyond the
range of Roman power, but not beyond the range of
Roman influence. We have seen the Western Empire
first pass to a German prince, then gradually shrink
into a German kingdom, to be finally dissolved into a
German confederation. We have watched the states
which split off at various dates from its body, the
power of France on one side, the power of Austria on
another, the powers of Italy on a third, the free states
of Switzerland at one end, the free states of the Netherlands
at the other. We have beheld the long tragedy
of the Eastern Rome; we have told the tale of the
states which split off from it and arose around it. We
have seen its territorial position pass to a barbarian
invader, and something like its position in men’s minds
pass to the mightiest of its spiritual disciples. And we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">{569}</a></span>
have seen, painted on the map of our own century, the
beginning of the great work which is giving back the
lands of the Eastern Rome to their own people. We
have then traced the shiftings of the powers which lay
wholly or partly beyond the bounds of either Empire,
the great Slavonic mainland, the Scandinavian and the
Iberian peninsulas, ending with that which is geographically
the most isolated land of all, the other world of
Britain. We have seen too how Europe may be said to
have spread herself beyond her geographical limits in the
foundation of new European states beyond the Ocean.
We have contrasted the different positions and destinies
of the colonizing European powers—where, as in the
days of Old Rome, a continuous territory has been
extended over neighbouring barbarian lands—where
growth beyond the sea was the natural outcome of
growth at home—where European powers have colonized
and conquered simply of their own free will. In
thus tracing the historical geography of Europe, we
have made the round of the world. But we have
never lost sight of Europe; we have never lost sight of
Rome. Wherever we have gone, we have carried
Europe with us; wherever we have gone, we have
never got beyond the power of the two influences
which, mingling into one, have made Europe all that it
has been. The whole of European history is embodied
in the formula which couples together the ‘rule of
Christ and Cæsar;’ and that joint rule still goes on, in
the shape of moral influence, wherever the tongues and
the culture of Europe win new realms for themselves
in the continents of the western or in the islands of the
southern Ocean.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In modern use we speak of <i>Spain</i> as only one part, though much the
larger part, of the peninsula, and of <i>Portugal</i> as another part. But
this simply comes from the accident that, for some centuries past, all
the other Spanish kingdoms have been joined under one government, while
Portugal has remained separate. In speaking of any time till near the
end of the fifteenth century of our æra, the word <i>Spain</i> must always
be used in the geographical sense, as the name of the whole peninsula.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> See the first chapter of his eighth book (vol. ii. p. 139 of
the Tauchnitz edition). He makes four peninsulas within peninsulas,
beginning from the south with Peloponnêsos, and he enlarges on the
general character of the country as made up of gulfs and promontories.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Ἤπειρος is simply the mainland, and came only gradually to mean a
particular country. We may compare the use of ‘terra firma’ in South
America. In the catalogue (<i>Iliad</i>, ii. 620-635), after the island
subjects of Odysseus have been reckoned up, we read: οἵ τ᾽ Ἤπειρον
ἔχον, ἠδ᾽ ἀντιπέραι᾽ ἐνέμοντο. This must mean the land afterwards
called Akarnania. It was remarked at a later time that the Akarnanians
were the only people of Greece who did not appear in the catalogue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> We shall come as we go on to two uses of the name in which Italy,
oddly enough, meant only the northern part of the land commonly so
called. But in both these cases the name had a purely political and
technical meaning, and it never came into common use in this sense.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Some may think that the Cisalpine Gauls ought to be excepted, as
the common Roman story represents them as having crossed the Alps from
Transalpine Gaul at a time which almost comes within the range of
contemporary history. But this is a point about which there is no real
certainty; and it seems quite as likely that the Gaulish settlements on
the Italian side of the Alps were as old as those on the other side.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> In a more minute study of the history it will be found that Latin
Africa held out against the Saracens very much longer than Syria
and Egypt. But for our purpose the two may be classed together in
opposition to those lands in Europe and Asia which always remained
Roman or Greek.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The geographical extent of the Frankish dominion before and after

c. 15.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> While I was revising this chapter, I became acquainted with C. J.
Jireček’s <i>Geschichte der Bulgaren</i> (Prag, 1876), the third chapter
of which is devoted to an examination of the early settlements of
the Slaves in the Eastern peninsula. He makes it probable that they
were there earlier than is generally thought. They seem, exactly
like the Teutons, to have first entered the Empire as captives and
colonists, a process which may have begun as early as the second and
third centuries. He shows also that the march of Theodoric into Italy
had the effect of laying a large region open to their settlements.
But he leaves my general propositions untouched. It is not till the
sixth century that those Slavonic movements began which are of real
importance to historical geography.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> So Wippo (2) describes the gathering of the men of the kingdom:
‘Cis et circa Rhenum castra locabant. Qui dum Galliam a Germanis
dividat, ex parte <i>Germaniæ</i> Saxones cum sibi adjacentibus Sclavis,
Franci orientales, Norici, Alamanni, convenere. De <i>Gallia</i> vero Franci
qui super Rhenum habitant, Ribuarii, Liutharingi, coadunati sunt.’ The
two sets of Franks are again distinguished from the Latin or French
‘Franci.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> No influence was more powerful for this end than the <i>Zollverein</i>
or customs union, which gradually united most of the German states
for certain purposes. But as it did not affect the boundaries or the
governments of sovereign states, it hardly concerns geography. Neither
do the strivings after more perfect union in 1848 and the following
years.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Compare the mention of Rudolf in the letter of Cnut, on his Roman
Pilgrimage, in Florence of Worcester, 1031. He is there ‘Rodulphus rex,
qui maxime ipsarum clausurarum dominatur.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> That Aosta was strictly Burgundian appears from the ‘Divisio
Imperii, 806’ (Pertz, Leges, i. 141), where Italy is granted whole
to Pippin, Burgundy is divided between Charles and Lewis; but it is
provided that both Charles and Lewis shall have success to Italy,
‘Karolus per vallem Augustanam quæ ad regnum ejus pertinet.’ The
Divisio Imperii of 839 is still plainer (Pertz, Leges, i. 373,
Scriptores, i. 434). There the one share takes in ‘Regnum Italiæ
partemque Burgundiæ, id est, vallem Augustanam,’ and certain other
districts. So Einhard (Vita Karoli, 15) excludes Aosta from Italy.
‘Italia tota, quæ ab Augusta Prætoria usque in Calabriam inferiorem, in
qua Græcorum et Beneventanorum constat esse confinia, porrigitur.’ As
Calabria was not part of Italy in this sense, so neither was Aosta.</p></div>

a Scandinavian name, but a name applied to the Swedes by the Fins.</p></div>

Thus the new <i>Sebastopol</i> answers to the old <i>Cherson</i>, while the new

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
